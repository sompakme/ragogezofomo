<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>5 Female Celebs Who Definitely Got Involved in Sugar Mama Dating</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Sugar momma dating is a growing trend. It refers to a relationship involving a younger guy in his 20s and an older woman, usually in her 40s and even 50s. These women have more disposable income than average people, and they realize that it’s not only fun but also lucrative to be a sugar mommy.&nbsp;</p><p>Hollywood celebrities seem to take this concept seriously because there’s a long list of female celebs who have been involved in sugar momma dating in the past.</p><p><strong>Why is Sugar Momma Dating Becoming Popular</strong>?</p><p>While Hollywood has always been full of double standards, you can notice a change with many famous women openly talking about their relationships with younger men. These affairs and relationships have also inspired more youthful men to look for a rich cougar who would pamper them and support them financially for their company. And they’re finding a way to make that happen through many dating platforms.</p><p>Anyone can now go online, sign up on a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sugar mama website</a>, engage in conversation with wealthy, older women, and find someone willing to take them in for a wild ride. It may not always be as simple as it sounds, but these platforms have made it possible for an average Joe to meet an affluent woman seeking a younger partner.&nbsp;</p><p>The great thing is that you can share your thoughts in chat rooms on these dating sites, and if you play your cards right, you can surely meet a sugar mama in no time. And if you need extra motivation, here are five female celebrities known for dating younger men. If those guys can do it, you sure can, as well!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kourtney_Kardashian></span>Kourtney Kardashian<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong> has dated many men in the past before her marriage to <strong><a href=#>Travis Barker</a></strong>, and the latest addition is a 23-year-old- Algerian model, <strong>Younes Bendjima</strong>. <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong> and <strong>Younes Bendjima</strong> have been spotted out together in Los Angeles on several occasions, but they haven’t made any public appearances since the rumors of their relationship surfaced.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple has been seen holding hands and popping sweet kisses at various events, so it looks like you can expect them to be romantically linked. It seems she loves younger men, and that’s why she was also rumored to be in a relationship with <strong><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a></strong> for a short time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jennifer_Lopez></span>Jennifer Lopez<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When it comes to&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong>, we all have our own opinions. Some fans love <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong>, while others hate her. But she’s a great example of a sugar momma who doesn’t mind dating younger guys and supporting them with all she has.</p><p>In the early 2000s, she was seen with younger hotties like <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> and <strong><a href=#>Usher</a></strong> at various events. She was also said to have had a short-term fling with <strong><a href=#>Drake</a></strong>, although many called it just a mutually beneficial PR.&nbsp;</p><p>But her relationship with her back dancer, <strong>Casper Smart</strong>, is an excellent example of her sugar mama dating experience, as the couple had an age gap of 17 years, and their relationship lasted more than two years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Madonna></span>Madonna<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you talk about a true sugar mama and someone constantly under discussion on any sugar momma dating site, you can’t keep <strong>Madonna</strong> out of the list. In a recent interview, <strong>Madonna</strong> said she’s never been into being silent about important issues. She also defended women who are victims of ageism.</p><p>She believes women should “own” their sexuality as it’s a vital part of female sexual expression, and there’s no certain age when you should stop feeling or saying what you believe. It also shows in her relationships, especially with Brazilian model <strong>Jesus Luz</strong>, who is 28 years younger than her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kris_Jenner></span>Kris Jenner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong> is a well-known celebrity who has been in the limelight for decades. She’s a great example of a cougar and a sugar momma, as she is successful, beautiful, and attracts the attention of younger men.</p><p>However, her relationship with <strong>Corey Gamble</strong> truly puts her in a league of her own, as he was just 36 when <strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong>, who was 61 at that time, started a relationship with him. She made it look like a 25-year age gap doesn’t matter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cameron_Diaz></span>Cameron Diaz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong><a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a></strong> has always attracted attention, from her debut role in <strong>The Mask</strong> and subsequent successful projects, where she looks fabulous and sexy. And she also has younger men on her dating list.</p><p>She dated <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong>, who was eight years younger than her, for a couple of years. In 2014, she was getting into a relationship with <strong>Benji Madden</strong>, who was seven years younger than her, which did not interfere with their romantic union at all.&nbsp;</p><p>They are happily married and have a daughter together, so it is evident that the age difference does not prevent them from being a solid couple.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">age-gap relationships</a>&nbsp;in Hollywood can be viewed as an opportunity for both parties to grow and develop their careers, sometimes these relationships are based on pure love.&nbsp;</p><p>However, you can always find a long list of female celebrities who go against all the odds and date younger guys, and this often inspires younger men, in general, to look for one such opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>Sugar dating sites are now available to help anyone live that dream. Just pick the right platform, and you might meet your <strong><a href=#>J.Lo</a></strong> in no time.</p><h5>NOTICE!! NOTICE!!
