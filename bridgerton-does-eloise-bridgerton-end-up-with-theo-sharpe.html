According to the novels, no. <strong>In fact, Theo Sharpe isn’t in the novels at all, and was only created for the TV show. </strong>According to the novels, Eloise actually ends up with Sir Phillip Crane, who fans will know is currently married to Marina Thompson, the distant cousin of the Featheringtons who is briefly engaged to Colin Bridgerton.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9bdf6c2d26a5-eloise-bridgerton-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eUsNCaqN6Hr3 data-wc=6><strong>Who does Eloise end up with?</strong></p><p id=e5JIWzM1fzC_ data-wc=74>In the books, Phillip is a widower, and he and Eloise become friends after she sends him a letter of condolences following Marina’s death. She spends more time with him at his home with his twins, only for her elder brothers to find out and demand that they wed to protect her honour. <strong>Of course, the pair eventually realise that they are in love with one another. But will the TV show follow suit?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eIEo4VcKhbD_ data-wc=60>Executive producer Shonda Rhimes has hinted that she plans to tell all of the Bridgerton love stories but didn’t reveal Eloise’s future, telling ET Online: "I can’t say anything about what’s going to happen after this season, but it’s always been my plan to focus on a Bridgerton sibling every season and it’s no secret that there are eight siblings.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEV0D9AsJ_-0 data-wc=1><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Alison Hammond cosy&nbsp;up to&nbsp;Bridgerton&nbsp;star Jonathan Bailey on the sofa</a></strong></p><p id=ewvw0QXDGEw- data-wc=1><strong>SHOP:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>10 Bridgerton-inspired dresses for the ultimate Regency style</a></strong></p><p id=e9Of9L1V6TH3 data-wc=31>"It depends on how much Netflix will want to continue with us.
