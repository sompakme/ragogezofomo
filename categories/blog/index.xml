YES! Actually, the dryer is responsible for the majority of the shrinkage. The larger the proportion of cotton in the mix, the greater the likelihood that the garment will shrink when washed in hot water. The larger the proportion of spandex in the clothing, the more probable it is that it will shrink as a result of the heat generated by the dryer.

When Masonite is installed, the area of the hardboard pierced by a fastener has the potential to absorb moisture. Masonite should always be waterproofed after installation in order to prevent structural failure of a piece of Masonite that has been successfully placed.

Individual neurons—or clusters of neurons—in the brain that code for stimuli that are perceptually meaningful are referred to as feature detectors. Sensory feature detectors tend to have basic traits early in their development, but as the features to which they react get more precise, they grow more complicated as they go down the sensory pathway.
