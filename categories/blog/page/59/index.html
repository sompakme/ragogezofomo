Inside everyone hides one desire
Outside no one would know
Danger, close as the edge of the knife
Safer not to let go
And whil we miss chances
You can almost hear time slipping awayWe close our eyes we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes to time slipping away
