For fans with a solid memory, you may recall catching a Sean Paul cameo in Belly. At the time, the dancehall artist was still a budding upstart compared to the superstar status that would soon follow. As it turns out, the film's star, DMX, had a lot to do with the appearance, and in a recent conversation with HipHopDX, Sean Paul recounted the moments that led up to the opportunity.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sheniz Halil: The Hottest Pics of Kanye's Cover Girl</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>

Even if you have zero interest in hip hop, you’ve probably heard by now that Kanye West dropped his seventh&nbsp;studio album, The Life of Pablo&nbsp;this week.
The LP already sparked a new feud between Kanye and Taylor&nbsp;Swift and inspired a ludicrously lavish star-studded launch party at Madison Square Garden.
Due to Kanye’s bizarre release strategy most of his fans haven’t even heard the album yet, and somehow it’s already at the center of a $15 million online heist.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Best Sweaters From Amazons Prime Early Access Sale</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>

I think most people can find a point of each season to critique: Winter is too cold, summer is too hot, and spring is too sneezy. If we’re Golidlocks and the seasons are a cup of porridge, then fall is what we’d call “just right.” The weather has found a middle ground, the leaves have started to turn, our favorite seasonal drinks have made their way back to menus, and we finally get to break out our cozy sweaters.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The hospital selfie is the dose of reality social media needs</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>

ShortcutsSocial mediaSo much of what we share online is fantasy, but posting pictures from a hospital bed helps people feel less isolated and can demystify disability and illness
Social media is often accused of presenting an airbrushed fantasy rather than a slice of realism, so it is refreshing to see the likes of Kate Beckinsale and Nicky Campbell embrace the “hospital selfie”, which involves tweeting photos from their hospital beds. (Alas, the Daily Mail’s Sarah Vine isn’t a fan, writing in her latest column: “Why the rest of us have to suffer I don’t know.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What does dying sod look like?</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>

If it tugs, it is dormant; but if it rips out in your hand, it is dead. Look for patterns. If a whole solid strip of your lawn is brown, it could be dormant grass. If the brown is in patches that do not resemble strips, the grass is dead. Can dying sod be saved? There is no way to revive dead grass, but you can lay new sod to grow your landscape again from scratch.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Will deer eat my corn plants?</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../will-deer-eat-my-corn-plants.html></a>
Answer
Deer will begin eating on and trampling down maize as soon as it is ready to be harvested. The plant will continue to develop until it reaches growth stage V5 as long as the growing point is not destroyed. Deer graze leaves from V6 till just before the tassel.
In a similar vein, you may wonder what creatures consume corn plants? Sweet corn (Zea mays) is a favourite treat for most animals, but the crop is particularly attractive to birds, raccoons, deer, squirrels, woodchucks, and insects such as the corn earworm, which feed on the plant.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Alec Baldwin and wife Hilaria make first red carpet appearance since charges from fatal shooting wer</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>
