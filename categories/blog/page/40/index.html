<a href=../../../../does-sheathing-go-over-fascia.html></a>
Answer
When sheathing a roof, the first step is to snap a line to ensure that the first row of sheathing is straight and uninterrupted. Alternatively, if you snap it at 40 inches, the sheathing will not protrude over the subfascia or real fascia as it would otherwise. By allowing gravity to work against you, you open the door to the chance of experiencing water damage. Please don’t do it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dru Down Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>
