The singer, actress, entrepreneur and everything in between, has been an off-duty dressing muse since her 90s R'n'B girly days, and for spring 2024 she's switched out her classic Birkin for the late royal's most renowned accessory.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Last Knights: Film Review</h2><time>Jul 6, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../last-knights-film-review.html></a>
“Only time will tell how we’re remembered,” intones Clive Owen in the new sword-clanging revenge epic in which he gets all medieval on our asses. Unfortunately, time—hell, not even the present—is likely to be kind to this misbegotten film which squanders the talents of not only Owen, enjoying a career resurgence thanks to his acclaimed turn in Cinemax’s The Knick, but also Morgan Freeman. The latter—spoiler alert—at least manages to exit the proceedings fairly early on.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nick Price Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Jul 6, 2024</time>

IMO, great makeup begins with an even better base. That means the primer you reach for and the setting spray you apply should benefit your beauty end goal. A primer well-worth your buck better create the perfect canvas for your makeup, while a great setting spray should always lock it all in. After testing dozens of noteworthy brands and products, I finally found the magic duo that does just that. Milk Makeup is the vegan beauty brand behind the iconic Future Fluid Cream Concealer, and not only does the brand have A-list followers, such as Hailey Bieber and Drew Barrymore, but it’s also going viral on TikTok.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What size are Chevy bellhousing bolts?</h2><time>Jul 6, 2024</time>
