Performance vehicles move parts even quicker, from engine internals, to transmission gears, to differentials, only making components hotter. Cooling temperatures throughout the drivetrain will not only keep a car running longer, but will potentially help it run quicker. Does a cooler running engine make more power? The Verdict: Hotter engines make more power. Sure, cooler air and fuel is denser, meaning more of it can fill combustion chambers to make more power, but once detonated, less energy (heat, in this case) being absorbed by engine material and coolant means more of it can be put toward forward motion.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to wear gladiator sandals</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>
