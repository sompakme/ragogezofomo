Answer
For example, Novus Plastic Polish, which is available at many autobody supply stores, may be used to polish plastic.

Once the polish has dry, you may use a soft cloth to buff the helmet to a deep sheen, comparable to that of a custom-painted automobile.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>When is Mother's Day in Nigeria 2022: mark your calendars</h2><time>Jul 31, 2024</time>
