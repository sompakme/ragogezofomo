Sweet pea
Apple of my eye
Don't know when and I don't know why
You're the only reason I keep on coming homeSweet pea
What's all this about
Don't get your way all you do is fuss and pout
You're the only reason I keep on coming home
I'm like the rock of Gibralter
I always seem to falter
And the words just get in the way
Oh I know I'm gonna crumble</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/36/>← Prev Page</a>
