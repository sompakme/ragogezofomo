However, plenty of avid fans in the comments&nbsp;pointed out&nbsp;that Boog's new baby mama is likely his girlfriend, Shelbie Gray, who has shared tons of photos of herself and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood star</a>&nbsp;on her Instagram story highlights. According to one user, the two of them went to Disneyland last week, but Shelbie was not seen&nbsp;riding any of the rides. Shelbie has currently privatized her&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;account, meaning she might be looking to&nbsp;get&nbsp;some privacy after possibly giving birth.</p><p>Paras Griffin/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This latest addition is Boog's&nbsp;fourth child.
