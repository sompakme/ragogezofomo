George Steinbrenner's death in 2010 did not mark the end of the New York Yankees' edict against beards and long hair. According to the official MLB website,&nbsp;the late exec's daughter Jennifer Steinbrenner-Swindal has made it a point to keep enforcing the policy, making sure that today's&nbsp;Yankees maintain an appearance that her father would have approved of. That's precisely the reason why Gerrit Cole, who was known for his long-ish hair and beard, switched to a clean-shaven look and a shorter (though not exactly short)&nbsp;hairdo after he signed a massive free-agent deal with the Yankees toward the end of 2019.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Victoria Asher Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>

Answer
People bring undesired gifts to parties, and then compete to grab the greatest games away from each other, as is the case with the game “Chinese Christmas,” according to reports. Why? Because that’s just how the Chinese are, yanno? Apparently, this game is referred to as the “White Elephant” game by others.
As a result, what exactly is the Chinese Christmas game? The person who drew number 1 selects a gift from the pile, opens the gift, and sits down with the gift in full sight, usually on her lap, as if she were receiving it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>WWE Goes the Extra Mile to Hype Up WrestleMania 40 Kickoff Press Event</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>
