Unmistakably the most unhinged chapter of an already unhinged franchise, Bachelor in Paradise has it all: sun, sea, and dozens of extremely attractive people on the hunt for love and/or Instagram followers. Last year's Paradise was particularly out of control, thanks to the record number of contestants who showed up on the beach, many of whom were greeted by Lil Jon, Lance Bass, Titus Burgess, and David Spade (yes, really)—and spoilers for Bachelor in Paradise in 2022 suggest things get even more unhinged this year.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Armored Core VI Weapons Tier List: Best To Worst Guns Ranked</h2><time>Aug 9, 2024</time>
