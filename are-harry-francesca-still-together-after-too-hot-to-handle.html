Sure, I should've been more focused on why Netflix decided to produce a show in the first place&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a32162313/too-hot-to-handle-netflix-cast-format/>where people get fined for any intimacy,</a>&nbsp;but let's leave that for a later date.</p><p>I was more intrigued by the show's couple that lost&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a32169863/too-hot-to-handle-cast-instagram/>the group of singles</a>&nbsp;the most prize money (over $30,000 from a once $100,000 pot!). Average viewers (a.k.a. me) thought Harry and Francesca were destined to just be a summer fling, but from what I've discovered on Instagram, it's a lot more complicated. Take what you will from my hours of Instagram stalking, below.</p><h2 id=harry-and-francesca-did-end-up-seeing-each-other-post-filming-3>Harry and Francesca did end up seeing each other post-filming.</h2><p>I'm not going to lie: When both of the cast members talked about seeing each other post-retreat, I laughed. The odds of Harry—a man who once had no remorse for turning the entire villa against his crush—traveling across the world for a girl he met three weeks ago seemed slim. Then again, love makes you do crazy things, like go on reality TV.</p><p>But a brief, two-hour, pre-bedtime scroll on Instagram has proved most of us wrong.</p><p>They! Are! Both! Posting! The! Same! Green! Car! (Side note: This car color is reserved for people who are either 1) hot or 2) SoundCloud rappers who make it big.)</p><p>In Francesca's post, you can clearly see the car has a British Columbia license plate. And Harry has tagged his location in B.C. Ladies and gentlemen, I spot a couple!</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

But the two went a bit above and beyond, making us wonder if there was actually trouble in paradise on February 14.</p><p>Posting a bikini pic on Valentine's Day? Normal-ish. Tagging your location as "Single Island"? Now that's a bit out of the ordinary. It's a&nbsp;possibility&nbsp;they could be over, or they were trying to throw us off the scent. Personally, I'm not sold, but I'll let you, faithful viewer, decide.</p><h2 id=they-aren-apos-t-quarantining-together-3>They aren't quarantining together.</h2><p>Just call me Sherlock Holmes. Based on their Instagram feeds I've gathered that the pair are not sheltering-in-place together. Harry, it seems, is currently in Los Angeles, keeping himself busy by taking pictures with his plants, while Francesca is at her apartment in Vancouver.</p><p>This may be because of their aforementioned contracts OR they actually are broken up. Francesca did recently&nbsp;tell&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32190622/francesca-farago-too-hot-to-handle-netflix-harry-dating/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Esquire</a>&nbsp;that because of COVID-19 she doesn't think there will be a&nbsp;Too Hot to Handle&nbsp;reunion, so you can kiss us getting any kind of update on anyone goodbye.</p><h2 id=they-finally-announced-they-are-together-and-looking-at-rings-3>They finally announced they are together....and looking at rings?</h2><p>Yes, I'm confused just as much as you. In an interview with&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.glamour.com/story/harry-francesca-netflix-too-hot-to-handle referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Glamour</a>,&nbsp;the pair told the publication they did break up for a couple of months (so my suspicious weren't wrong!) due to " a few miscommunication areas."</p><p>But like all good stories, reality shows, you get the gist; this does indeed have a happy ending. Francesca said when quarantine is over, her next steps would be to move into a house in L.A. with Harry. He then joked that by the fourth day, he'd probably want to marry her, and they both slipped that they have a shared folder of wedding rings!&nbsp;<strong>Yes, RINGS!</strong></p><p>Now that's settled, I can sleep in peace knowing my detective skills are still top-notch.</p><p>For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the&nbsp;Marie Claire&nbsp;newsletter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url="https://link.marieclaire.com/join/3oa/mar-newsletter?authId=F0CC0C27-80DA-4734-ABDF-E4115B84A56B&maj=WNL&min=ARTICLES" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>subscribe here</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiZY2d%2FdXyXaWpomaKaeqmt0auwZp6ilruksdKcmGarpJ65rXnTqJ6erJiav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-best-ultra-league-teams-for-pokemon-go-season-of-timeless-travels.html><span>←</span><span>5 best Ultra League teams for Pokemon GO Season of Timeless Travels</span></a>
