It marks their progress and growth, both physically and emotionally. Birthdays provide an occasion to reflect on the child's development, achievements, and accomplishments over the past year.</p><p class=align-left>Legit.ng reached out to <a id=https://www.instagram.com/tolaseedy/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Adetola Seedy</a>, the lead pastor of Peace Church Global, to explain how birthday prayers and blessings impact children. he said:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/01a184b77d1a6cb2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>90+ happy wedding anniversary quotes for parents from loving kids</span></p></a>I believe in the effectiveness of prayers and blessings, and I strongly advocate for them especially on children (because they have clean slates). I have personally been involved in many of such prayers and I also have friends who insist that prayers that their parents kept repeating over them ultimately helped them get it right. It is plausible that you have a good sense of self-worth when you repeatedly hear words of blessings, and the power of those words ultimately help with one’s spiritual well-being (Proverbs 18:21, Romans 10:17).<h3>Adorable birthday prayers for a child</h3><p class=align-left>Children anticipate surprises and good wishes from the time they wake up on their birthday. You <a href=#>can</a> share any of the birthday prayers for a boy or girl listed below with them.</p><ul><li>Today I ask God to bless you with every kind of joy on your birthday and always.
