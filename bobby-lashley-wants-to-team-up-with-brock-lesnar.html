That being said, we have a newer, hairier, and happier Beast Incarnate wandering around. According to Bobby Lashley, he believes that a team with Lesnar would be pretty cool.</p><p>Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley are great rivals, but they might be even better allies. The Beast Incarnate recently came up in a conversation with the Almighty, and Lashley opened up about a far-fetched idea he has.</p><p>Sony Sports Network’s show, Next Stop Hollywood, recently spoke to Bobby Lashley. He jumped on the idea that he might be down to team up with Brock Lesnar.</p><p>“This is completely farfetched on a whole different angle. I thought me and Brock, we fight a lot against each other, what if we were on the same team? We’ll be like the modern-day Road Warriors. It’ll probably be fun. The crowd will probably get off on watching us go through dismantling people together. That would be pretty interesting.”</p><p>Bobby Lashley and Brock Lesnar last met at the 2023 Elimination Chamber event. Their match ended via DQ, and then their paths separated on the road to WrestleMania.</p><p>Right now, <a href=#>Brock Lesnar is slated to face Omos at WrestleMania 39,</a> in match that was a highly controversial decision. Bobby Lashley also has his hands full with Bray Wyatt <a href=#>on that wild Firefly Fun House ride.</a></p><p>Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley might have more to the story, but it’s unlikely that they will ever team up. Then again, you never know what can happen in pro wrestling, because Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley certainly have a unique chemistry in the ring.</p><p>Do you think Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley might be a good team?
