"If you don't know my daughter name, then we ain't really [dawgs]," the "IFHY" star raps near the end of the song. Of course, many took this as a straight-up revelation, and <a href=# rel>social media exploded with their takes on it</a>. "Wait did Tyler just reveal he has a daughter #or is he just rappin?" one user wrote. Furthermore, it seems like he caught on to speculation quick, as he took to Twitter to respond to these fan theories and clear the air.</p><p>"I dont have kids and dont plan on it hahaha," he wrote about a half hour after the song debuted. With that, it seems like T was just rapping and talking his smack over a gorgeous instrumental as he often does. Meanwhile, most of the discussion online unsurprisingly revolved around love for this new track and excitement for his upcoming <a href=# rel>CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST: The Estate Sale</a>, which is an expanded version of his acclaimed 2021 Gangsta Grillz-style tape with <a href=# class=text-word rel>DJ Drama</a> with songs that didn't make the final cut.</p><span><h2 id=h-tyler-the-creator-doesn-t-have-a-daughter-or-plans-to-have-kids>Tyler, The Creator Doesn't Have A Daughter, Or Plans To Have Kids</h2></span><p>In other Tyler-related news, both fans and fellow artists alike are huge fans of his style, creativity, and musical output. For example, Lil Yachty recently said that the 32-year-old was the one who inspired him to make his latest album Let's Start Here. Not only that, but he also expressed a strong desire to <a href=# rel>make a collab album with him one day</a>. Considering Yachty's own skills in a breadth of musical styles and genres, both their artistic visions could mesh incredibly well.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of the greatest artists of our generation will appear in Hulu's "<a href=# rel>RapCaviar Presents</a>" series alongside the likes of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a>, Coi Leray, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Polo G</a>, and many more. In a trailer for the series, which premieres on March 30, he revealed some <a href=# rel>crucial advice</a> that <a href=# class=text-word rel>Pharrell</a> gave him. "Make something undeniable and make it equally as infectious,” the Neptunes producer told him. “Why are you doing music? Is it because you just want to look cool? Because that will burn out. When it becomes purpose-oriented, it can be as cool as the flashy s**t, but it will be much more meaningful." Then, Tyler thought, "Oh, f**k. No more being silly. Music first. At that moment, we went home, and I just wanted to change everything. I just wanted to switch. And the switch f***ing happened." With that in mind, come back to HNHH for the latest news and updates from Tyler, The Creator and his upcoming project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdman52gJVmq7Kklad6tbTEZpqrnZGpvLN5wqWcmqqjYsKxecOarKCgpJq%2FbrjIp5xmp55iu6bDjKygp5%2Bcmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-burns-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Burns Net Worth 2024</span></a>
