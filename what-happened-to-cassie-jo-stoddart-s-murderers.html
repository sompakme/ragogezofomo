Per All That's Interesting, he was unable to say what movie they had seen. Soon after, Draper escorted the authorities to Black Rock Canyon near Pocatello. There, the boys had hidden evidence, including knives, masks, and a videotape. Adamcik and Draper had filmed themselves planning Stoddart's murder and their reactions to killing her.</p><p>All That's Interesting explains that Adamcik and Draper also mention <a href=#>Ted Bundy</a>, the Zodiac Killer, and the Columbine school shooting in the video. Per the Idaho State Journal, Draper states, "we're going to make history." He added, "I feel like I want to kill somebody. Uh, I know that's not normal, but what the hell."&nbsp;<a href=#>The Spokesman-Review</a>&nbsp;writes that Adamcik and Draper, who were then 16, were subsequently charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFkG5qcW9frLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScmaOotqZ5yahkrKyfmbGivtOsZKatopmys7HRrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-beckham-reveals-why-she-cried-at-paris-fashion-show-amid-nicola-peltz-feud-rumors.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Beckham reveals why she cried at Paris fashion show amid Nicola Peltz feud rumors</span></a>
