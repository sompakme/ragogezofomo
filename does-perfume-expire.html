She must have had at least twenty brightly colored bottles in all different shapes and sizes. Now that I am older, I can say that I probably have a collection of twenty perfumes, if not more. Over the years, I have received perfumes for every holiday that you can think of. However, my&nbsp;growing collection&nbsp;has made me wonder if perfume expires. Considering the price points of most fragrances, knowing whether or not to throw away a perfume you've had for a while can be a hard decision to make. So, how can you tell? I tapped three of the country's top perfumers for their expertise.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li>Clement Gavarry is a senior perfumer at&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Firmenich</a>. He has worked on creating many famous scents for brands such as Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Chlo√©.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Jacques Huclier</a>&nbsp;is a perfumer at&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Givaudan</a>. He has created fragrances for brands like Gucci, Thierry Mugler, and Hugo Boss.</li><li>Gabriela Chelariu is a senior perfumer at&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Firmenich</a>. She has created perfumes for brands such as Nest and Abercrombie & Fitch, as well as for celebrities such as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Gwen Stefani</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>Jennifer Lopez</a>.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, once a bottle of perfume has been opened, it will eventually expire.&nbsp;"Spraying a perfume allows air into the bottle, which oxidizes the fragrance over time," said Gavarry. "You'll notice a severely reduced signature of the fragrance itself. It will not smell sparkling."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The good news is, on average, an open fragrance can last about two years. As for an unopened bottle, Huclier said it can last several years depending on how it is stored.&nbsp;"I recently had the chance to evaluate a never-opened bottle of perfume from the '80s, and it was, like, brand new," Huclier told us. "There's no cardinal rule; each fragrance has a different lifespan."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Huclier, the shelf life of fragrances is extending longer than before, as many perfumers now use stabilizers and UV filters, making the molecules less sensitive to oxidation. That said, it's definitely a good idea to finish one bottle before you start using another.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-identify-expired-perfume></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Identify Expired Perfume</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can tell if a perfume has expired when the smell is slightly sour, especially as the top notes oxidize. This can have a slight metallic scent.&nbsp;"Oxygen within the air can alter some of the molecules in a fragrance over time," explained Huclier. "Generally, top notes like citrus, fruits, aromatics, green notes, and patchouli are most sensitive to oxidation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best way to check if a perfume has expired is to spray it on a piece of paper to see if you detect any off-note. This method also assures that you don't have the scent on you all day, especially if it has expired. "Another indication that perfume has expired is discoloration [of the juice]," suggested Huclier.&nbsp;Gavarry noted, "You can also check to see if the color or shade of the juice itself has changed. If it looks darker or has a yellow tint, it typically means the fragrance has oxidized."</p><p>The trusted nose of a friend can also help you determine if it's time to throw the perfume out. Ask for someone's opinion.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-right-way-to-store-perfume></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Right Way to Store Perfume</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How long perfume lasts also depends on how it's stored. Keep perfumes far from any heat source. Oxygen, light, and heat are the biggest enemies of perfume.&nbsp;"If the fragrance is kept away from sunlight and high temperatures, it will last longer," Gavarry added. "If the fragrance is kept in warm temperatures, the juice will turn faster, and it will only have a shelf-life of three to six months."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To extend the life of a perfume, it's best to store it in a cool, dark place, away from heat and daylight, as UV light can harm the fragrance and break down its formula," advised Chelariu. "Keeping a fragrance in the refrigerator is actually the best climate and storage space."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some perfumes tend to last longer than others.&nbsp;"In general, perfumes with spicy, wood, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vanilla notes</a>&nbsp;tend to sustain a longer shelf life than other perfumes in different olfactive categories," Chelariu said. "The nature of the natural ingredients within these formulas are more potent and structurally stable."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Huclier explained that these rich base notes are less volatile and have a greater resistance to oxidation since they are less fragile.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-using-expired-perfume></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Using Expired Perfume</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you unknowingly or knowingly apply perfume that has expired, not much will happen ‚Äî other than smelling a little off, that is.&nbsp;"It's not very common for a person to have an adverse reaction to an expired perfume," said Chelariu. "There is a natural process of oxidation that happens during the life of every perfume, and this can generate compounds in the juice that are irritating for certain skin types."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w6icrGWgmr%2BnwcyeZJ6woJ6%2FpnmUbG9pbGVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daren-bates-net-worth-2024.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Daren Bates Net Worth 2024</span></a>
