This led to a WrestleMania 18 main event match, but it didn’t turn out the way he would have liked at all.</p><p>While speaking to Inside The Ropes, Y2J went into some detail about how The Rock vs Hulk Hogan overshadowed his WrestleMania main event. This led to a hollow achievement when it comes to being able to claim that he had an actual Mania main event.</p><p>“Let’s be honest, the main event and the fact that it was on last, but the main event of the show was Hogan and Rock and I knew it. Most people would be pitching for their match to go on last, I was pitching for it not to go on last.”</p><p>“I was like, ‘How do you follow Hogan and Rock?’ and Triple H — rightfully so he was fighting for the title match to be last, but we couldn’t follow it, we just couldn’t and you could see the air go out of the room — that’s a match I’ve never watched it back. Because I remember being kinda disappointed in it, you know?”</p><p>Jericho said that he spoke to CM Punk years later about why The Second City Savior left WWE and one of his reasons was the he never main evented the show of shows.</p><p>“I said dude, you worked with the Undertaker at WrestleMania — that’s the main event, any Taker match’ — he says ‘Well you can say that because you were on last.’ I said, ‘Okay I was on last, but I wasn’t the main event.”</p><p>Jericho can still say that he technically had a main event match at WrestleMania which is something that CM Punk can’t. However, it is hard to argue that The Rock vs Hulk Hogan didn’t steal the show.</p><p>If you need further proof, their faces are the ones featured on WrestleMania X8 posters and not Triple H and Chris Jericho.</p><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>If&nbsp;you&nbsp;use&nbsp;our&nbsp;quotes&nbsp;credit&nbsp;<a href=#>Ringside&nbsp;News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49sZmptX5i1s7XSZqGeqpmYtbB50pqwrGWknbJuvs6comauo2K1trjKZp%2Bon5Gjeq2xxa1koaGdYrGqv8Cpp6ihnqmypXnIp2ShoaNixLOx0q2jnqWRo7aiecyaoKdllauyr8CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jordyn-jones-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-and-rumours.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jordyn Jones Dating Now?
