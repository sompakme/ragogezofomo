We’re happy to work with them to achieve this,” she said.</p><p>NSW Environment Minister James Griffin has been slightly more proactive than his federal counterpart, hinting at an interstate intervention.</p><p>“I have asked the NSW Environment Protection Authority to immediately work together with the Victorian EPA and Recycling Victoria to better understand the challenges impacting REDcycle’s operations,” he said.</p><p>REDcycle collected about 7000 tonnes of soft plastic each year and was almost entirely dependent on the Close the Loop factory to convert the waste into usable materials.</p><p>But it all came crumbling down in June when a fire on the production line at the outer Melbourne suburban factory put it out of action.</p><p>The inferno burnt for five hours, and it took over 50 firefighters to bring it under control.</p><p>In a market announcement shortly after, Close the Loop said it would return to operation within six months – that date has since been pushed back to mid-2023 as part of an expansion.</p><p>Close the Loop CEO Joe Foster detailed the immense lack of soft plastic recycling infrastructure in Australia.</p><p>“They were dependent on us to move volumes. The fact that we found the solution [to recycling soft plastics] many years ago was obviously a very good outcome,” he said.</p><p>“Nobody in the industry wants the post-consumer, heavily contaminated material, whereas we can take it on.”</p><p>During that time, REDcycle continued to accept huge amounts of waste, which it no longer had means of recycling, deciding to conceal the issue from Coles and Woolworths, with everyday recyclers none the wiser.</p><p>REDcycle is yet to disclose how much soft plastic remains stockpiled, nor has it explained its decision to omit information about the breakdown in its recycling capacity to its partners and the public.</p><p>“There are no recycling options available for soft plastic in Australia,” it did, however, concede in a statement.</p><p>“REDcycle is storing the material, at their own expense, to keep it out of landfill.”</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“There wasn’t a secret or official suspension of recycling activities. REDcycle has repeatedly tried to find alternative recycling solutions to fix the problem.”</p><p>REDcycle says it will process its stockpiled soft plastic when Close the Loop returns to operation.</p><p>Soft plastic waste is considered one of the most challenging materials to recycle because of varying types of plastic and contamination.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Melbourne data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Melbourne</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7056aoaafobyoxY6epa%2BhoqS7rrHNrWasoZ6cuaZ5xaKpnmWSmrWqusNmqq6olae6or7KnqtmqpWYxqS4yKeeZquTlrulrctopZ6vo2LAtbvRsmaccGGWr6aAkGqYn5pmaYZxgcRqZ2mbaWywpn%2BQcG9vaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nelly-furtado-reveals-split-from-husband-says-she-is-ready-to-date.html><span>←</span><span>Nelly Furtado reveals split from husband, says she is ready to date</span></a>
