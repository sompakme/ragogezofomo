When Offerman read The Last Of Us‘ <a href=#>script</a> he was intrigued but didn’t feel like he had time on his schedule. His wife–actress Megan Mullally took one look at the script and immediately had other plans for her husband.&nbsp;</p><p>“They sent me the script and I didn’t have time on my calendar to say yes to this job, and my incredible goddess of a wife read it and said, ‘You’re going to <a href=#>Calgary</a>, buddy. Have fun. You have to do this,'” Offerman told Kimmel during the interview. Luckily for Offerman, Mullally’s hunch seems to have been fruitful.</p><p>The episode has been hailed as one of the best episodes of television to come out this year. Its tender storytelling and heartwrenching conclusion cement The Last Of Us as a breakout hit of the season. Offerman’s role in the episode was cited by none other than <a href=#>Jeff Bezos</a> for his incredible work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nick-offerman-bill-last-of-us-900x534.png><p>The clip also shows a number of reaction videos to the episode. Most of the videos feature viewers in the midst of crying. Many of them share the sentiment that they’d signed up for a show about zombies and were blindsided by the beautiful and heartwrenching storytelling.</p><p>The Last of Us has become one in a series of titles that have taken video games and adapted them to television. Many fans have hailed it as one of the best video game adaptations to come out, ever.</p><p>Nick Offerman appears in episode 3 of The Last Of Us titled “Long, Long Time” as the character Bill. Without giving too much away, the episode focuses on Bill’s backstory and his relationship with his partner Frank. The two characters were originally side characters in the video game but were given expanded roles in the adaptation.</p><p>The episode is filled with easter eggs and references to its video game source material. However, it diverges at key points in order to create a more robust story for these characters. The episode shows the potential of how television and video game storytelling can complement and build upon one another in fascinating and entertaining ways.</p><p>Nick Offerman’s appearance on The Last Of Us may be a shift for some fans. The actor is likely best known for his portrayal of Ron Swanson on the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation. The character was known for his deadpan delivery and penchant for solitude.</p><p>Since <a href=#>Parks and Recreation</a>, Offerman had a role in the film The Founder as Richard McDonald of fast-food chain fame. He also appeared as Karl Weathers in the second season of the FX crime drama series Fargo. This role marks a welcome departure from his Ron Swanson character and gives viewers a glimpse at his acting chops.</p><p>The Last Of Us is a post-apocalyptic survival thriller series about a group of survivors traveling across a post-outbreak United States landscape. It is adapted from the video game franchise of the same name. If the most recent episode is any indication, the series could continue to gain critical and commercial success as the season rolls on.</p><p>Viewers can watch new episodes of The Last Of Us on Sundays via HBO.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2immZi4brvFn5yrpZGjeq2t0q1kqJ5dqsBufo2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mississippi-republicans-charge-ahead-with-jim-crow-redux.html><span>←</span><span>Mississippi Republicans Charge Ahead With Jim Crow Redux</span></a>
