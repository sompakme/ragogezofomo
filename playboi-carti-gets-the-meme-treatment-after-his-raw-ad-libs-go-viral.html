Having said all of that, fans could not help but make some jokes about what they were hearing.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-playboi-carti-ad-libs-are-something-else>Playboi Carti Ad-Libs Are Something Else</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the tweets down below, you can see a plethora of memes about Carti and his ad-libs.
