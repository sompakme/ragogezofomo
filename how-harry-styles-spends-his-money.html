One of his more notable art purchases appears to have been in 2014, when <a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;reported that he spent $33,000 on 20 typewriter-themed pieces by controversial U.K. artist Hayden Kays. A source explained of the artwork, "They are social commentary and involve mind games. They have a theme of love and sex. ... Harry and Hayden have a creative understanding and admire each other's creativity."</p><p dir=ltr>By that next year, Styles' art collection had grown, with the Daily Star valuing it at more than $240,000 (via <a href=#>AZCentral</a>). The "Dunkirk" actor was reported to not only have paintings and gun sculptures, but also a $16,000 lamp created by artists Joe Armitage and&nbsp;Thomas Campbell, as well as&nbsp;jewelry designer Dominic Jones. If that's not enough, Styles had allegedly wanted murals to be painted inside of his home, too, by famous street artists Bambi or Banksy. "An entire wall painted by Bambi would run into a five-figure sum, but that wouldn't faze Harry — and he knows how precious art is as an investment," an insider dished.</p><p dir=ltr>When Styles isn't trying to purchase art, he still spends his money and time appreciating it, like when he visited the Royal Academy of Arts in London with then-girlfriend Olivia Wilde for his 28th birthday in February 2022. A witness told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, "Harry and Olivia looked like they were having lots of fun as they browsed the gallery."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlia4B6hI6hprBlmJa%2Fs8WMrKuypJWoerS8xKebrGWYnsBuuc6nnLJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guy-williams-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Guy Williams Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
