Addressing the audience he said: “This is the woman I love, apparently she loves me.”</p><p>The 65-year-old asked the question last night (Thursday, June 15) during his performance at the O2 arena, sparking a grand applause from the audience. As his Hans Zimmer Live show was coming to an end, he brought his partner on stage and said: “There’s one more thing. So this is the woman I love, apparently she loves me.”</p><p>He then turned to her and asked: “Why did I bring you up here? I was going to ask you something really important. Did you lock the back door? Is the milk in the fridge? Do we have any sorbet in the freezer? Will you marry me?”</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Video shows Harry Styles help expectant mum with 'adorable' baby gender reveal on stage at Wembley Stadium show</a></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article27134429.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/3_hz1.png><p>He added: “Things are working out well, The backdoor is locked. Everything is good. I’ve got this one little number left. It’s intimate in its insignificance but maybe not so insignificant and maybe I quite like it,” before performing his famous song Time. He also played the piano for the song, with his fiancee next to him.</p><p>At one point during the performance, he took to the floor with one of his musicians to play guitar amongst the crowds and stopped momentarily to hug and kiss his partner. He later clarified that it was not just some “random woman” in the audience he was embracing.</p><p>Throughout the show, he led his band and the Ukrainian Odessa Orchestra as they treated fans to a host of songs he composed for Blockbuster films such as Gladiator, Pirates Of The Caribbean, The Dark Knight, Interstellar and the James Bond film No Time To Die.</p><p>The show had been carefully curated with laser lights and beams to create a unique sense of grandeur. He also paid tribute to the Ukrainian orchestra. He said: “I would really to thank our orchestra because our orchestra is special, our orchestra is from Odessa in Ukraine.</p><p>“I think it takes enormous courage to sit here, smile at you, play without flaw for three hours while you do not know what’s going on at home and everything is going on at home.”</p><p>One of the performers also waved a Ukrainian flag on stage as the musicians took their final bows. His tour, Hans Zimmer Live, continues in the UK and Europe until June 25.
