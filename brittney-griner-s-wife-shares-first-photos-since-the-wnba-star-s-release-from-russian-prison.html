The athlete was in Russia at the time to play in the Russian women's professional basketball league. She admitted to having the cartridges, but said it was an accident that she had packed them, and documents showed the cannabis oil was legally prescribed to her by her U.S. doctor for pain management, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna60683 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NBC News" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">NBC News</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"As BG and I start our journey to heal our minds, bodies, and spirits— I wanted to personally say thank you to some of the hands; seen and unseen, that helped make it possible for me to see my wife again!"
