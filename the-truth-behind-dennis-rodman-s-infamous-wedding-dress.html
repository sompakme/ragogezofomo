As <a href=#>Michael Kaskey-Blomain</a> of CBS Sports tells us, the incident took place on August 21, 1996, and Rodman wore his famous wedding dress and veil to a Manhattan event where he was promoting Bad As I Wanna Be, his recent autobiography. To really make a splash, he also arrived to the location in a neat, horse-drawn carriage.</p><p>As a curious detail, Rodman did come up with the idea on his own, but he might not have actually pulled it off if it wasn't for Steven Tyler. Shortly before the incident, Rodman and Tyler happened to be at the same hotel gym, and when the athlete ran his idea by the musician, Tyler was over the moon. "He was like, 'That's awesome. That's great'," Rodman told <a href=#>USA Today</a> in 2019, before admitting that this once jaw-dropping stunt might not work as well these days. "I never knew wearing a wedding dress on Fifth Avenue was going to make that impact. We shocked the world. But today it would be a common thing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bj29tbW1fqbWmedOrrK2gXZeyqbXNnWSdnZ6jtrR50aibppmeqHqqusWapKito2LEprDDoqWgZZSnsrS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reginald-hudlin-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Reginald Hudlin Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
