Behind the slickly produced hit records (“Silence,” “Wolves,” “Friends,” “Alone”) and the omnipresent smiley bucket head is Marshmello’s well-oiled marketing dream team; his hard-charging manager, Moe Shalizi, is often credited for the speedy creation of the Marshmello brand, and networking has helped, too — shoutouts from other big-name EDM acts like Skrillex and Tiesto proved invaluable to his early success.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>It was only three years ago that Marshmello bought his L.A. starter house,&nbsp;<a href=#>a $3.6 million contemporary in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood</a>. But with his career showing no sign of stoppage —&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes says</a>&nbsp;he earned a whopping $56 million during 2019 alone — a big residential upgrade has seemed all but inevitable.</p><p>Built in 1992 and designed by Richard Landry — the celebrity-favored architect who frequently puts the “extra” in extravagant — the stylistically opaque house boasts interiors by Jeff Lewis, who was hired to right previous decor wrongs. The blindingly white result has more than a subtle Miami vibe and was featured on Bravo’s Million Dollar Listing by the seller’s agents, Josh and Matt Altman of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Altman Brothers Team</a>&nbsp;at Douglas Elliman.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Ekaterina Chubarova</a>&nbsp;at LA Estate Brokerage repped Marshmello.</p><p>While the house itself is not gated, the property lies within a 24/7 guarded community with frequent patrols and a plethora of security cameras. Glass front doors open into a double-height foyer with marble floors. Flanking the foyer are a fireplace-equipped living room and a dining room with dual chandeliers. Just beyond lies an eat-in kitchen with dual islands and all the expected top-of-the-line stainless appliances. There’s also a library/office and a family room that opens, via French doors, to a sprawling back patio.</p><p>Upstairs are four en suite bedrooms, including a jazzed-up master with its own kitchenette, plus spa-style bath and dual closets. The nearly 8,000-square-foot mansion also boasts a finished basement level; a lounge/entertainment center with a snazzy wet bar awaits downstairs.</p><p><span>O</span>ut back, the hillside lot is steep but nicely terraced with adequate patches of grassy lawn and concrete terraces for al fresco dining — or perhaps impromptu, friends-and-family-only Marshmello performances. Naturally, there’s also a backyard swimming pool and spa for when Marshmello needs to wash off the chewy sweetness. Views overlook the surrounding Sherman Oaks hills, with sightlines soaring deep into the San Fernando Valley.</p><p>This story first appeared on&nbsp;Dirt.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvRnpilZZWowaLAxGikmqqjnbqmuMuoZJutqah6rsHLoaalpJGjsW6x0q2YrZ2jYrWwwdKeZJ%2BnomJ%2BcXmXZqSipJyevK95kGtqbXFkbH9zf44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-savoca-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>John Savoca Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
