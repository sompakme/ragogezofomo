Moreover, they've been pretty at odds for a long time, although it was previously more of a somewhat light rivalry between two moguls in hip-hop. Now that these as-of-yet unconfirmed claims around Sean Combs are more publicly scrutinized than ever, the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G-Unit</a> rapper is more than happy to troll and clown him consistently, whether in serious or unserious ways. For example, one of his recent Instagram posts also evokes one of his other feuds with The Big Apple's top rap tier.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Anybody seen J? LOL [laughing emojis] puff said the [ninja emoji] ain’t answering his phone. LOL," 50 Cent captioned a picture of a <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a> missing ad on a carton of milk. Of course, this is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">far from the only joke he made about Diddy's allegations</a>, ones that fired up even more with this raid news. While some fans always enjoy Fif's IG antics, others are more cautious in engaging in these discussions about a much more serious topic. However, perhaps there will be a more somber reflection on this down the pipeline from other huge industry stars, although we doubt that he'll be the one to do so.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-wants-people-to-find-jay-z-amid-diddy-raid>50 Cent Wants People To Find Jay-Z Amid Diddy Raid</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, this also ties into <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">50 Cent's long-documented rift with Jay-Z</a>, which isn't really a super contentious hip-hop beef either. Competition is a big part of these moguls' behavior around each other, something that the former has always championed against Hov and Puff. The Queens native is also much more confrontational in the grand scheme, and isn't afraid to stir up controversy online to try to get under their skin. Still, this does remind folks that the Roc Nation boss remains quite silent on the Diddy situation, but to be fair, he's silent about pretty much anything these days.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As such, it's hard to predict whether more of music's elite will comment on these abhorrent claims, whether unprompted or solicited. Maybe next time, the BMF executive will bring in <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his beef with yet another rap head honcho</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a>. Whatever he posts next, we're sure that it will be another troll with any possible target under the sun.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbX1zf5Jmm6KclK56s63InWRuaF2Ysq%2FAjKOYsmWqYrWqvIyhpqllnprEtA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-sailor-s-grave-sea-of-thieves.html><span>←</span><span>Where is sailor's grave Sea of Thieves?</span></a>
