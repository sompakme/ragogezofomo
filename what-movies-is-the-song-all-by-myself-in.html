 It wasn’t until 1995 that the song began to appear in American films, thanks to the release of two satirical comedies that used it: Clueless and To Die For.

 In this sense, what movie did I appear in entirely by myself? Dawn of the Dead (2004 edition) and Shrek 2 have all made use of this song. Clueless is a good example of this, with Jewel performing as Cher (Alicia Silverstone) while she travels Beverly Hills and analyses her love life throughout the film."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
