He admitted to importing more than 40kg of drugs between 2006 and 2007, though the Crown prosecution argued it was at least 200kg.</p><p>“The offender played a senior role (characterised as middle level management) in an enterprise that was well planned and of some sophistication,” District Court Judge Andrew Haesler said in his judgment at the time.</p><p>“His role was critical to its success. He took a degree of risk, with an expectation of large reward. His motive was personal profit and greed.”</p><p>Moradian was sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years and five months and was first available for release in December 2017.</p><p>He also admitted to dealing in $1.6m worth of proceeds of crime.</p><p>The Daily Telegraph reported at the time that in emails tendered during his court proceedings, Moradian was likened by his wife Natasha to TV mafia figure Tony Soprano.</p><p>The court was told at the time that Moradian decked out his Pennant Hills home with luxury and designer items, cars, and motorcycles.</p><p>“Why do you just sit there and show off … do you see Tony Soprano doing that? He points it all off on junior for a reason – to take the heat away from him,” the email said in a reference to a storyline on the hit drama series involving Tony Soprano and his uncle Junior.</p><p>“You, on the other hand, want the attention, you get a big head, you love it. People like that won’t survive.”</p><p>After his arrest, Moradian’s solicitor arranged for the surrender of firearms – including a machine gun, grenade launcher and automatic rifle – as well as ammunition.</p><p>Moradian was alleged to have links with the Comanchero outlaw bikie gang and the Sydney underworld.</p><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=a80a0144b8ebad51ba8ff02a17a52f18 data-tgev-label=national data-tgev-metric=ev>He was shot in what police believe was a targeted attack</a> in an underground carpark at Bondi Junction on Tuesday morning.</p><p>The 48-year-old was found dead in an Audi in the Spring St carpark around 8.15am after multiple shots were fired.</p><p>Police tried to resuscitate him when they arrived on scene at 8.30am, but he was pronounced dead.</p><p>Two men were reportedly spotted fleeing the vicinity after the shooting, and a burnt-out Porsche was found nearby on James St shortly afterwards.</p><p>A second scorched car was found more than 6km away in Zetland just before 9am that police also believe is linked to the assassination.</p><p>Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty said police believed “at least two” people were involved in the shooting, which had “the hallmarks of being an organised crime murder”.</p><p>“We’re saying this is a well-planned and executed murder of a high-level criminal identity,” he told reporters on Tuesday.</p><p>The police officer confirmed the 48-year-old was a “major player” in the organised crime network who had “strong, high-level links” to the Comanchero bikie gang.</p><p>“He was a high-level identity in the criminal network, so he was a high-level target for these shooters,” Superintendent Doherty said.</p><p>“He obviously had a big target on his back.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGSws7XMnmapnZ%2BluaZ5y6KinmWkna61edaopa1lo6q%2Ft7XVnmScoJmhuaq6xmaumqqenruoecGenaiqlWLCr7DEq66oqpyZeq7B0Z2cq2eemsS0edKtpquxX26GeoHAcJpwbZZpfaeBmGyZcmplZbFxsJBvbWyZlmmF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./24-memes-all-socially-awkward-people-will-understand-too-well.html><span>←</span><span>24 Memes All Socially Awkward People Will Understand Too Well</span></a>
