The Red Group features Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev, Andrey Rublev, and Alexander Zverev. The top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals in a knock-out stage. The two winners of the semifinals will then meet in the final.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Djokovic is the defending champion, having defeated Casper Ruud in the finals of the 2022 event. He has his sights on finishing as the ATP Year-End No. 1 for the record-extending eighth time. The Serbian is the current World No. 1, though he’ll face stiff competition from the <a href=#>number two-ranked Alcarez</a>, who famously defeated Novak at Wimbledon this year.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Djokovic is the betting favorite to win the ATP Final.
