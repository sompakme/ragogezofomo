So I have this crazy, elaborate system of Google Docs that all funnels this outline that can run dozens of pages, and then I use that for my master document before I start writing. I even outline my shorter pieces, as well. I’m kind of an obsessive outliner… When I’m writing, I’ll get up at six, eat lunch, and then keep writing. I tend to get the most done in the morning and at night, and not a lot after lunch. I think that’s my least productive time of day. I don’t know–my dog wakes me up. He’s quiet, though, so it’s ok.”<p class=align-left>Indeed, as any eloquent journalist, she got a good education.
