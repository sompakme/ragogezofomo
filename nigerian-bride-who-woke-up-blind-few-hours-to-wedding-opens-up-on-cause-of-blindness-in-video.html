"I woke up the next day blind. Like I couldn't see. My pupils were diluted. My eyes started tearing as the light ray was too much for my eyes to comprehend."My vision was totally blur. I could only see very blur shapes but nothing more. I was completely blind only 24 hours to my wedding. "I was taken back to the drugstore where I bought the eye drop and the pharmacist that prescribed the eye drop to me was not on shift. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/21590af953e55ace.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian woman walks cheerfully to hospital not knowing her first son already died, video trends</span></p></a>"Because of the intensity of the situation, she was called to come to the drugstore asap. The other pharmacist couldn't understand why I was given such eye drop."The eye drop was mostly used for eye surgery or by an ophthalmologist to purposely dilate the pupils to fully examine the health of the optive nerve and the retina. "To think I was given such extreme eye drop was out of everyone's understanding. When the pharmacist came she was scared. Seeing how seriously sensitive the situation was, they booked me for an immediate optometrist appointment."When we got to the optometrist, as soon as he examined my eyes he told me it would take a while for me to regain my sight fully and there's no way I would get my sight restored in 24 hours so I might have to go on with my wedding in that condition. I cried so much. The devil tried but he failed."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b4608202218dd42c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian mum in disbelief after seeing condition of little daughter she took to grandma's place</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> reached out to an eye doctor, Samuel Olayiwola, who also gave wrong prescription as the reason for her blindness.</p><p class=align-left>In his words:</p>"Oh no this is clearly wrong dosage.
