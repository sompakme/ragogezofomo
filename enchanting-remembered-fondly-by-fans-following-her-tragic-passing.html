Earlier in the day on June 11, a stunning report came through that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">1017 labelmate</a>, Enchanting, was on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">life support</a>. No further information was provided, but the news was broken by the rapper and singer's sister Kayy Jayy via Facebook. On top of her sister, family, and friends going through it, multiple publications were reporting that she had already passed on. However, Kayy Jayy immediately shut down the rumors, saying, "Can y'all stop posting you have actual facts. She's still fighting, she's not dead... I'm here at the hospital. My sister is not dead". Sadly though, the worse result imaginable happened, as Enchanting <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">lost her life</a> not too long after being taken off life support. Fans and artists <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">have been in shock</a> over this news, as a lot of them saw true potential in Enchanting.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There is already a massive X (formerly Twitter) thread of her supporters shedding light on how much she left ahead of her. Many are recognizing that she was incredibly versatile, being able to shift from mellow R&B to aggressive trap rap. Others are just having a hard time mustering anything, as Enchanting's death happened out of nowhere. You can see the overflowing love and adoration for the 26-year-old below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fans-recognized-enchanting-was-next-up>Fans Recognized Enchanting Was Next Up</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Enchanting felt that her talents were undeniable, showing that she was ready to take over and show the world what she had to offer. She expressed that in a 2023 interview with the Dallas Observer, explaining, "I feel like music was always something that was easy for me. I felt like I was musically inclined, always. It was something that I thought should probably put more time and effort into, because it was natural, you know, instead of trying to force a talent". <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">That God given ability</a> to create and inspire will certainly never be lost in the minds and hearts of her fans and the community at large. We continue to send our <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sincerest condolences</a> to Enchanting's loved ones during this difficult time.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Enchanting's passing?
