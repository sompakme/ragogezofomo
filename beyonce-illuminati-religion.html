<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Beyonce Illuminati Religion</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, better known as Beyoncé is perhaps one of the most controversial celebrities on the planet.&nbsp;Amid her undeniable success, she has drawn a lot of controversy, especially from conspiracy theorists.&nbsp;The biggest question has always been whether she is a member of the Illuminati, and if not, what her true religion is.&nbsp;These are difficult questions to answer but we will leave it to you to judge after having exposed the facts.</span></p><h2><span>What does the word Illuminati refer to</span></h2><p><span>Illuminati is a word that originated at the end of the 16th century.&nbsp;It comes from the Latin word illuminatur, which means “enlightened”.&nbsp;This is a large group of like-minded individuals who claim to possess special enlightenment or rather knowledge of something usually hidden from others who do not subscribe to their school of thought.&nbsp;It can be seen by many as a clandestine organization that would run all facets of the world.</span></p><p><span>Although the organization has existed for several centuries, it is only recently that Internet conspiracy theorists have begun to actively talk about it.&nbsp;Today, even the mainstream media can’t help but ask questions that need answers.&nbsp;Illuminati uses occult symbolism and subliminal messages to convey hidden messages to unsuspecting audiences.&nbsp;The group’s ultimate goal is to carry what is referred to as the New World Order when devil worship takes center stage.</span></p><h2><span>What is Beyoncé’s connection to the Illuminati?</span></h2><p><span>She is at the center of all the conspiraciesHer Royal Highness Beyoncé Knowles Carter and her husband Shawn Corey Carter, better known as Jay Z. The couples are believed to be the current leaders of the group, with Jay Z being the king and Beyoncé the queen .&nbsp;Accusations and counter-accusations come from all directions that both men are working extra hours to recruit unsuspecting members of the public who subscribe to their beliefs.</span></p><p><span>The two are believed to run the organization and control the global entertainment industry, politics, and finance, among other things.&nbsp;Based on some confessions from disgruntled members, it’s likely that the allegations are true and that the two aren’t human, as one might think.&nbsp;As you may know, Beyoncé is a singer, songwriter, model, and actress.&nbsp;She would have used her talent to promote the occult activities of the group.</span></p><h2><span>Beyoncé’s religion</span></h2><p><span>All of his songs, according to conspiracy theorists have hidden meanings which mostly insult Christianity and promote satanic activities.&nbsp;These theories are believable, especially when you break down the song lyrics or read them backwards.&nbsp;Every time Beyoncé makes a video of her songs, the keen eyes of someone familiar with Illuminati symbolism won’t help but see many occult symbols.&nbsp;His poses, facial expressions, and staging reveal a certain pattern that can be associated with the occult organization.</span></p><p><span>One of the most common symbols associated with Illuminati is a one-eyed pyramid.&nbsp;It is also the symbol of Freemasonry.&nbsp;Most people believe that there are very close ties between the two secret organizations.&nbsp;Beyoncé has been seen several times performing on a stage bearing the symbol.&nbsp;Plus, she’s used to doing the pyramid with her hands over one eye.&nbsp;It is therefore not surprising that all members of the government join the group and that they generally eliminate the symbols at will, indicating their affiliation with the satanic organization.</span></p><p><span>One of her most controversial events is her claim that she was born again.&nbsp;It can only mean that her old man was gone and she became a new person.&nbsp;Many people now believe that Beyoncé was baptized enlightenment and became a full member.&nbsp;Other songs she wrote speak volumes about this change.&nbsp;Her marriage to Jay Z is also seen as another step taken by the secret organization to strengthen itself.</span></p><p><span>To top it off, Beyoncé’s so-called baby girl Blue Ivy Carter would be the true face of evil.&nbsp;Conspiracy theorists believe the name choice was no coincidence;&nbsp;it actually has a hidden meaning.&nbsp;They think Blue Ivy is the code for Born Living Under Evil, the youngest of the Illuminati.&nbsp;It may have dug so deep, but it’s not out of place for me to think the same way.&nbsp;How the hell did they think of such a name?&nbsp;It certainly means something.</span></p><p><span>To sum up, there is compelling evidence to believe that Beyoncé is actually Queen of the Illuminati and that her religion is Satanism.&nbsp;She has openly decided to turn her back on Christianity and now seems to be working more time promoting satanic activities that will culminate in the New World Order.&nbsp;That’s according to the conspirators.&nbsp;All we can do is wait with bated breath to see what she will achieve.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiala68r6%2FEZqClpKWitq%2Bt06Jkq52cnrSqu81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-estj-anime-characters-you-need-to-know-about.html><span>←</span><span>Best ESTJ Anime Characters You Need To Know About</span></a>
