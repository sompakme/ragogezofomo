In a new Instagram post where she takes the time to reflect on the Spanish-language music that she released in 2022, the superstar singer wore a pair of relaxed-fit cargo pants in a bold camo pattern.

Her hair was styled in a slicked-back wet look, and she added a soft red lip color, skipping out on her usual go-to scarlet shade. Her gallery included behind-the-scenes looks at the making of her album,&nbsp;Aguilera.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Celebrating one year of La Fuerza ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• I truly cherish the creative process behind all my albums. The time spent recording&nbsp;Aguilera&nbsp;in Miami reminded me that my love for making Latin music will always be a part of my soul," she wrote.

Lopez went on to share that she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt get off the film," and the rest is history. Madonna went on to kiss Spears that night and give an entire generation a core memory.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They got Christina Aguilera, I think, to do it,‚Äù Lopez added, which drew the ire of fans, who believed that Lopez was&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>slighting the singer</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Van Toffler, MTV's president, explained the whole situation over a decade ago.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">‚ÄúIt was a long road to get to that Britney and Christina kiss, because they weren't necessarily the first couple of people who were on the hit list,‚Äù he&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said in 2012</a>. ‚ÄúThis may be the first time it‚Äôs revealed, but originally J.Lo was in the mix.
