"There's never a point in my life where I loved my body, never, ever.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fox continued, “When I was little, that was an obsession I had of, like, ‘But I should look this way.’ And why I had an awareness of my body that young? I'm not sure, and it definitely wasn't environmental because I grew up in a very religious environment where bodies weren't even acknowledged. The journey of loving myself is going to be never-ending, I think.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Greg Swales/SPORTS ILLUSTRATED</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere in her feature, Megan also shared about the pressures that come with being a part of such an iconic package. “Shooting Sports Illustrated Swimsuit is definitely a lot of pressure," she said of her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shipwreck-themed photos</a>. "I have a vision in my head that I'm trying to achieve, so we'll see if it pans out for me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, “What I most want people to know is that I'm a genuine soul who is hoping to actually belong to something and not always have to live as a misunderstood outcast.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn’t the first time that the mother-of-three has been open about her relationship with her body — she first spoke about it publicly when gracing the cover of GQ Style with her then-boyfriend, now-fiancé, Machine Gun Kelly, back in October 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We may look at somebody and think, 'That person's so beautiful. Their life must be so easy.' They most likely don't feel that way about themselves,” she told the publication at the time. “I have body dysmorphia. I have a lot of deep insecurities.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6emqZdm7y5ecGom7JllK7ArrvRqZ%2BimV2ovbC%2B06xkoqScqsC1vsCtnJ1lo6y2rnmWbXBycWln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-far-is-houston-from-san-antonio.html><span>←</span><span>How Far Is Houston From San Antonio</span></a>
