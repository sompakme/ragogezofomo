I associated, like society taught me, that theater was for gays, and it was for sissies, and things like that. Things that you were taught to be ashamed of."</p><p>"It was 1988 when I came out," Hayes, <a href=#>who recently faced a health scare</a>, continued. "It's so cliché that it was during Thanksgiving weekend. My mom said I needed to go see a therapist. She wrote me a 10-page letter, both sides on legal pad size paper. 'This is not what God....' You know, the whole uneducated view of it."</p><p>Thankfully, she eventually began to accept her son for who he is.&nbsp;"She became educated and had friends who [were] gay people," he went on. "She was like, 'Oh I see. You're just like me,' and all that. It became fine and wonderful, and then she became so supportive and awesome."</p><p>Nowadays, Hayes,&nbsp;<a href=#>who married composer Scott Icenogle in 2014</a>, couldn't be happier that Will & Grace&nbsp;was<a href=#>&nbsp;revived</a>&nbsp;after 11 years off the air in 2017. As he explained, the hit NBC sitcom, which received <a href=#>a Golden Globe nomination for Best Television Comedy</a>, can once again be used as a reference point by LGBTQ youth when coming out.</p><p>"If you don't have the words to explain it to your family, you can say, 'Like&nbsp;Will & Grace,' or 'Like&nbsp;Ellen DeGeneres,' or whosever out in a public," Hayes said.&nbsp;"There's so many more examples now to help people and give them tools to communicate to kids and their families that being gay is as normal as being straight. There's no difference."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhkaH9ye9KemKdlmJbGpr%2BMqKeepqNivaK1zZ%2BspWWTpLqqusZmnLGolae2prrCnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-byer-instagram-wikipedia-biography-age-height-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Byer Instagram, Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth</span></a>
