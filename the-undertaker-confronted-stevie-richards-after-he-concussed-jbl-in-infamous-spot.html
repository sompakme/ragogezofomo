This commitment has earned him a legendary status, recognized for his numerous achievements. His contributions to the world of professional wrestling are unparalleled and his legacy will always be respected. That being said, it appears The Undertaker confronted Stevie Richards after the latter concussed JBL in a now-infamous spot.</p><p>On the July 4, 2005 taping of SmackDown, The Blue Meanie defeated JBL in a singles match. The match gained infamy for Stevie Richards interfering in the match and hitting JBL on the head with a brutal chair shot, which ended up concussing him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The chair shot was payback for JBL legitimately punching The Blue Meanie during the final moments of ECW One Night Stand 2005. While speaking on <a href=#>Wrestling Shoot Interviews</a>, Stevie Richards revealed that The Undertaker confronted him following the match.</p><p>“So he comes up to me, he goes, ‘Hey! Let me talk to you for a second.’ His demeanor wasn’t intimidating, but he was like, ‘Hey, our roster’s really thin right now. We can’t afford to lose anybody. What you just did there, we’re probably gonna be down a guy.’ And I go to Taker, ‘I swear to God, I did not do it purposely. I didn’t do it. I’m waiting back here to see if he’s okay, so if he comes back here and punches me or does whatever, I’m standing right here, I’m not running from it.'”</p><p>JBL didn’t suffer a serious injury and was back in the ring a few weeks later. Regardless, The Undertaker was the locker room leader and had to make sure things were kept in order no matter what.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on this story?
