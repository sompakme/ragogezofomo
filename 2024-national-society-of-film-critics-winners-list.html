Awards may also be given out to film not in the English language, nonfiction film, production design and film heritage.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This year, the group began with a number of special awards, including film heritage honors for <a href=# id=auto-tag_criterion data-tag=criterion>Criterion</a> Channel and Facets, Kim’s Video, Scarecrow Video and Vidiots.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The NSFC praised Criterion for its “adventurous, wide-ranging, finely curated selection of films, ranging from American independents to world cinema to short films to classic Hollywood, making readily available the kind of repertory cinema that every city should have.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Facet’s, Kim’s Video, Scarecrow Video and Vidiots were recognized for “maintaining wide-reaching libraries of films on disc and tape and making those libraries available to the general public.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Voting is conducted via a weighted ballot system, <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/NatSocFilmCrix>the group explained on its X (formerly known as Twitter) account</a>. On the first ballot, members vote for their top three choices, with the first choice getting three points, second choice getting two points and third choice getting one point. The nominee that receives the most points and appears on the majority of ballots wins. If no winner is declared on the first ballot, the category goes to a second ballot, without proxies. Voting continues with as many rounds as necessary until a nominee receives the most points and appears on the majority of ballots.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Any film that debuted in theaters or on streaming platforms in the U.S. during 2023 was eligible for awards consideration.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Last year, the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/national-society-of-film-critics-2023-winners-list-1235292966/>NSFC named Tár as its best film of 2022</a>, with Cate Blanchett also awarded best actress for her starring role and writer-director Todd Field getting the best screenplay award.
