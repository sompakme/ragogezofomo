Ricky Gervais has hit back at criticism of a joke about a dead baby included in his latest stand-up routine.
Two bereaved parents reportedly walked out of the controversial British comedian's recent show in Belfast - part of his Humanity tour - over a joke about a dead baby.
Belfast Live reported the couple, Suzi and Ryan Gourley, lost their newborn son last July."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
