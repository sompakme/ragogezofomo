If the code is still on the screen, unplug the washer or turn off the power for one minute to clear it. During the Clean Washer cycle, it was discovered that there were items in the washer. Items should be removed from the drum before starting the Clean Washer cycle a second time.</span><span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span>What is the best way to reset my Maytag front-load washer?</span></b></h3><p><span>How to Reset a Maytag Washer (with Pictures)</span></p><p><span>To turn off or cancel the computer, use the “Power/Cancel” button.</span></p><p><span>To choose a new cycle, press the button that corresponds to it.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>To begin or stop the recording, press “Start/Pause.” You have now completed the reset of your Maytag washer.</span><span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span>What is the procedure for turning off the control lock on my Maytag washer?</span></b></h3><p><span>Control Lock may be turned off by pressing and holding the Options key with the words “Control Lock Hold 3 Sec” below it for 3 seconds. For 3 seconds, press and hold the CONTROL LOCK button in the Options options if there is a specific Control Lock button on the dishwasher (press the words “Control Lock).</span><span></span></p><h3><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></h3><h3><b><span>How do you troubleshoot a Maytag washer that has an SD code?</span></b></h3><p><span>Maytag accepts that error codes such as “Sd” might emerge by accident from time to time. To erase the code from the screen, press the “Pause/Cancel” button twice or the “Power” button once. Then attempt to use the washer once again. The error will reappear if you do not disconnect the washer for 60 seconds before starting the cycle again and phoning for help.</span><span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span>What does the code f21 on a Maytag washing machine mean?</span></b></h3><p><span>In this case, the draining cycle will take longer than eight minutes, as shown by the code ‘F21.’ The source of this may be attributed to a variety of issues, including a malfunctioning drain pump and a malfunctioning door switch. Most often, foreign particles clogging up the drain line, pump filter, or even the pump itself are the root cause of the problem.</span><span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span>What is the procedure for unlocking a Maytag washer?</span></b></h3><p><span>Locate the bottom of the door switch/lock mechanism by reaching up along the inside of the front and up along the inside of the back. A tear-shaped tab may be found on the bottom of the door switch/lock mechanism, towards the bottom of the door. Gently pull the tab down approximately 1/4 inch, or until you hear a click, until the tab is released. It is now possible to open the door.</span><span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span>What does the code e1 f9 on a Maytag washer mean?</span></b></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span>It is possible and perhaps likely that the error code F9 E1 will be shown if the washer detects that there are too many suds in the wash cycle. If the black drain line on the back of the washer is kinked or obstructed, the error code F9 E1 will appear on the computer screen. You may do a quick visual inspection of the drain pipe to see if there is any type of clog.</span><span></span></p><h3><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></h3><h3><b><span>What does the code f21 on my washing machine indicate exactly?</span></b></h3><p><span>The Whirlpool washer error code F21 indicates that the washing machine is experiencing a “water draining issue,” which might be caused by a blocked drain pump or a clogged drain hose, causing the washer to have difficulty emptying the water out. To put it another way, the washer is taking an excessive amount of time to drain the water out of the tub.</span><span></span></p><h3><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></h3><h3><b><span>What do the numbers e01 and f09 on a Maytag washer mean?</span></b></h3><p><span>The error code E01 F09 on a Whirlpool Duet washer indicates a LONG DRAIN TIME. When your Whirlpool washer enters drain mode and the drain time has passed 8 minutes without reaching the reset level in the pressure sensor, the valves in the drain are shut off and the drain pump will stop pumping water out of the machine.</span><span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></h3><h3><b><span>What is the best way to troubleshoot a Maytag washer?</span></b></h3><p><span>Repairing and troubleshooting a Maytag washing machine Determine the amount of work to be done. Verify that the washer is connected to an electrical outlet by pressing the button on the machine. Remove any kinks that may have formed in the drain pipe. Close the lid of the washer tightly to provide more pressure on the lid switch. Stay away from packing your cargo too tightly. A poorly balanced and heavily loaded truck might cause a buildup of water in the tank, which can lead to a leak.</span><span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span>What is the proper way to reset a washing machine?</span></b></h3><p><span>Resetting the washing machine is simple: To switch off the washer, press the POWER button. Alternatively, unplug the washer from its power outlet or switch off the circuit breaker that serves the machine. While the power is turned off, press and hold the START/PAUSE button for 5 seconds to begin the process. Reconnect the washer’s hoses or reset the circuit breaker if necessary.</span><span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b><span>How do you re-set a front-loading washing machine?</span></b></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><span>Resetting the washing machine is simple: To switch off the washer, press the POWER button.

During a washing cycle, larger objects or loads have a tendency to settle on one side of the drum. Try redistributing the load or removing a few pieces of clothes from the load before running the spin cycle on your washer once again.</span><span></span></p><h3><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></h3><h3><b><span>What is causing my Maytag washer to get stuck in the wash cycle?</span></b></h3><p><span>Most likely, the timer in your top-load washing machine (or in some older front-load washers) is malfunctioning, and the machine will not move and forward to a subsequent wash cycle. If this is the case, the washer timer should be replaced. During the wash, spin, and rinse cycles, the timer on your washing machine regulates all components of the process.</span><span></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn5qsXZm8pr%2BMrZ%2BeZZOksaZ5wqVkpp2Ro3qwuoymsGalka7BorOMsJisoJWne6nAzKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rihanna-s-coachella-outfit-goes-loud-luxury-with-a-fur-coat.html><span>←</span><span>Rihanna's Coachella Outfit Goes Loud Luxury With a Fur Coat</span></a>
