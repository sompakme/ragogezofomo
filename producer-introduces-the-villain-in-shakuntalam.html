The film is currently in its post-production stage and fans are thrilled to watch the film at the earliest. In the meantime, producer Neelima spills the beans about Shakuntalam during a Q&A round on Instagram.</p><p>Answering several questions posed by the fans, Neelima revealed that Kabir Duhan Singh will be playing the main antagonist in Shakuntalam. He plays the role of King Asura and she wrote, “So much hard work he has put in for the massive action sequences. The armour he had on weighed some 30 kilos. Thank you Kabir Ji for your efforts”.</p><p>She further revealed that Shaakuntalam will be released in all five languages, including Hindi. And therefore, after The Family Man series, Sam will treat her North fans with this mythological drama. Also, citing the humongous success of the Pan-India film Pushpa, it remains to see what holds in future for Sam.</p><p>She went on to talk about Allu Arjun’s daughter Arha’s look in the film. She wrote, “Was just wonderful with Allu Arha. She looks so cute like a snowflake in the film” and praised makeup artist Ronan’s hard work. Shakuntalam is based on a popular Indian play Shakuntala by Kalidasa. Samantha will be seen in the titular role of Shakuntala and Dev Mohan as Dushyanta.</p><p class=post-tag>Tags <a href=# rel=tag>Kabir Duhan Singh</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcp52nqHxygY9yaHJnoKe8pcHCnqlmoZ6pv7Cw1JycrGWknbJuwsilo5qhnmK2r3nSoZikrZ6prq2tzA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patricia-richardson-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Patricia Richardson Net Worth 2024</span></a>
