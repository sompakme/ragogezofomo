The photo included his siblings, Jeffrey Jordan and Jasmine Jordan, and their mom, Juanita Vanoy. Marcus tagged his brother and sister and dubbed his mother "Mama Ja" in the photo because she did not have an Instagram account. The next month, Marcus's girlfriend,&nbsp;Larsa Pippen, posted to her Instagram Stories telling people to follow Vanoy's new account.</p><p dir=ltr>For her first few posts, Vanoy posted a few photos with friends. Plus, she added pictures and videos to her Story Highlights from a birthday trip to New York City. Besides those few personal posts, Vanoy mostly used the page to promote her business ventures. The ex-wife of Michael Jordan had started her own boutique business called <a href=#>Juanita World</a>, which resells designer goods such as clothing, shoes, handbags, and accessories. According to the About section of the company's website, Vanoy "personally purchased" the goods for sale from Juanita World while also leveraging her relationships with "reliable wholesale partners." Vanoy included a description of herself on the website. "I'm also an enthusiastic world traveler, a passionate art collector, a champagne connoisseur and a self-proclaimed shopaholic," she wrote. "I'm blessed to have amassed the collection of my dreams ... but now it is time for some of these luscious luxuries to have a new home," Vanoy added.</p><p dir=ltr>Besides the Juanita World venture, Vanoy was also involved in a popular Broadway play.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxlbYZ3f46moJygkZq5brbOq5uapl2axW7DyJ%2BcZqKllruqwMBmrZqmn656uLTArZyvnaJitaK8z56lnpxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-little-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Little Net Worth 2024</span></a>
