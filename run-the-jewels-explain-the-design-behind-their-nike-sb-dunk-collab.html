For instance, he notes that the Nike SB Dunk Low pays homage to Run The Jewels 3. As he explains, the softer tones speak on a much moodier record. However, Run The Jewels 4 is much more in your face, which is why you get those harsh pink and black tones. Moreover, El-P goes on to speak about all of the little intricacies and how he really wanted to make these unique to the group. Overall, they accomplished that mission.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-run-the-jewels-x-nike-sb-dunks-release-date>Run The Jewels x Nike SB Dunks Release Date</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As it stands, <strong>these are currently on the market</strong> and they released on <strong>April 20th, 2023</strong>.
