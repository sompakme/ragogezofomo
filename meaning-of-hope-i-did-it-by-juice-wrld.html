This addresses the consequences of personal flaws and the continuous effort required to overcome them.The lyric, "I'm tryna give you my soul, you can see the ugly in it," further emphasizes the theme of vulnerability. It portrays the desire to expose oneself, flaws and all, to their partner fully. It explores the fear of being rejected or judged for the parts of oneself that may not be considered pleasing. This theme highlights the importance of acceptance and finding someone who can see past the perceived flaws and appreciate the true essence of an individual."You done killed all my depression, you don't get it" is a powerful lyric that showcases the theme of redemption and the transformative power of love. It touches upon the healing effect a relationship can have on one's mental state, emphasizing how the love and support from a partner can help overcome personal struggles.
