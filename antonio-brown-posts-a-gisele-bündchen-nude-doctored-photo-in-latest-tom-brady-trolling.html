At this point, it is unclear if Antonio Brown is trying to shoot his shot with the super model or if he just has a vendetta against <strong>Tom Brady</strong>. All we know is that these actions won't be taken lightly by Brady himself, whose ex-wife is the butt of all <strong>Antonio Brown's</strong> recent jokes. By extension, these jokes are also from Brown against <strong>Tom Brady</strong> and this bullying cannot continue.</p><p>Previous photoshopped images placed AB's face on <strong>Tom Brady's</strong> in an image where <strong>Gisele </strong>is hugging the QB. Brown later used Gisele Bündchen's image to sell t-shirts without asking permission. The wide receiver was pressed about this by the folks of <a href=#><strong>Valuetainment on Youtube</strong></a>, but Brown just stumbled on his responses and could've offer a clear answer. <strong>Brady </strong>has kept quiet about this so far, but this latest "joke" has finally crossed a line.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen confirm their divorce</span><span class=ue-c-article__media-author><span>MC</span></span></p></figure><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Antonio Brown's NSFW Snapchat</h2><p>About eleven days ago, <strong>Antonio Brown</strong> uploaded an intimate video where he appears to have sex with a woman whose identity wasn't revealed until later. It was later revealed that the model from that first video as <strong>Cydney Moreau</strong>, who mysteriously looks like <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong> and used to date AB. But Brown's <strong>Snapchat </strong>post from Tuesday morning is what drove people crazy.</p><p>On his stories, <strong>Antonio Brown</strong> posted a clearly photoshopped image of <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong>. Why is that important you say? Because the super model appears topless and uncensored but the image is clearly an animation he found somewhere. Even if the image is not real, Antonio Brown is still clearly provoking Tom Brady and his ex-wife. This should get a response from the <strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong>' QB but he still hasn't responded.</p><p>Somebody needs to keep checking on <strong>Antonio Brown</strong> on a regular basis, his behavior is increasingly more erratic. If he keeps this up, he will inevitably get himself in legal trouble that will potentially cost him millions of dollars. <strong>Tom Brady</strong> and <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong> can easily sue him for difamation and indecent exposure alluding to their private life. Brown immediately erased the image but screen shot fingers are too fast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeklrqxrYybmLJlkqqwpK3Nnpyrq19nfXN%2BjmpoaGpiZIN0g8NtaGxqYmuFpn%2FEnmxpbmiXgXd8xWefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./after-giving-birth-to-5-children-nigerian-mother-returns-to-school-bags-university-degree.html><span>←</span><span>After Giving Birth to 5 Children, Nigerian Mother Returns to School, Bags University Degree</span></a>
