Within <a href=#>"Bachelor Nation" alone, multiple contestants have died by suicide</a>, including Julien Hug, who was 35, and Clint Arlis at age 34, per&nbsp;<a href=#>The San Diego Union-Tribune</a> and <a href=#>Page Six</a>, respectively. Meanwhile, Gia Allemand's August 2013 death was all over the news for days as she clung to life in the hospital following her suicide attempt, leaving fans hoping for the best.</p><p>Allemand was a dance instructor who appeared on Jake Pavelka's season of "The Bachelor," the show's 14th season. She also appeared on multiple seasons of "Bachelor Pad," which has since morphed into "Bachelor in Paradise." Per <a href=#>ABC News</a>, a New Orleans police report revealed that&nbsp;Allemand's suicide occurred after a nasty fight with her boyfriend, NBA player Ryan Anderson, whom she believed to have cheated and who reportedly said he no longer loved her. She was later put on life support at a nearby hospital, but sadly passed away a couple of days later at the age of 29.</p><p>"The entire Bachelor family is tremendously saddened by the tragic passing of our friend, Gia," said "The Bachelor" creator Mike Fleiss in a statement (via <a href=#>CNN</a>). "She was truly a sweet and generous soul. This is a devastating loss for anyone who ever knew her."</p><p>If you or someone you know needs help with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline​ by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhman15go6rnJqkmanGbsDVZqqtmaKoeri0zmabop2UYq%2Bmss6rnGasmJrGbsPEq5xma2Bk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./princess-anne-s-daredevil-past-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Princess Anne's daredevil past revealed</span></a>
