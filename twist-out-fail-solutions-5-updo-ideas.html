But no matter your skill level, many of us have experienced a so-called "twist-out fail."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes it's a matter of unraveling your twists before they're completely dry, other times it's because you didn't use the right products. Either way, it sucks. But just because your look didn't go as planned, it doesn't mean you need to throw your hair in a head wrap and call it a day (unless you actually want to, of course). There are a plethora of updo options for you, and if all else fails, you can always just pick your hair out and rock an afro.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To give you a few ideas, we spoke with celebrity hairstylist and Cantu ambassador <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Angela Stevens</a>. All of her suggestions and tips for the perfect twist-out save, ahead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-twisted-pompadour></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Twisted Pompadour</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let the gorgeous Janelle Monae be your style inspiration for this look, but keep in mind that the length of your hair will dictate your styling options. If you have a tapered cut like Monae, feel free to pick out the top of your hair and let it flow freely. However, if you have some more length around the sides and back of your head then you'll want to follow Stevens' styling tips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Section off some hair at the top of your head for bangs," she shares. "Then spray the remaining loose hair with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Cantu Avocado Hydrating Curling Cream</a>. From there, create one loose flat twist along the nape of your neck from right to left, securing the twist with bobby pins. Twist the sectioned off bangs and join with the first flat twist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you're done, feel free to lay down your edges using your go-to edge control, or let them stay textured if that's more your jam.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bantu-knots></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bantu Knots</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bantu knots are a quick and easy way to create a structural updo with minimal effort — and you can even keep the same parts you used to create your twists to speed things up. Simply redo your two-strand twists, or twist the entire section of hair around your finger, then wrap it around the base of the hair. Secure with either a bobby pin or hair elastic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a smooth finish, simply spritz the hair with some water and apply a gel or pomade to the hair before you start twisting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 6 Twisted Hairstyle Ideas for Anyone with Natural Hair</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-crown-braid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Crown Braid</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crown braids are nothing if not regal, but that doesn't mean they're complicated to craft. Even comedian Quinta B did hers herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"First, moisturize your scalp with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Cantu Tea Tree & Jojoba Hair & Scalp Oil</a>, follow up by parting your hair into classic pigtails," says Stevens. "Then, create two french braids. Join and pin them with bobby pins."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Seriously, it's as simple as that.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faux-hawk></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Faux Hawk</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once your hair is out of twists, start off by smoothing out the sides using your favorite gel. We love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Eco Styler's Olive Oil Styling Gel</a>. "Then grab two medium sized naturally-colored hair clips and brushing up each side, place the clips upward for a simple and refined look," says Stevens.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to add a little extra oomph to the look, add in a cute hairband like Tamera Mowry.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-curly-bun></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Curly Bun</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"First, apply <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Cantu Leave-In Conditioning Cream</a>," Stevens suggests, in order to add softness and shine. Next, brush your hair upwards and secure with a hair tie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you have thicker hair and want to achieve a sleek low ponytail or high bun, create the ponytail with half the head of hair, then slick up the remaining hair around the previously made ponytail," the hairstylist advises.
