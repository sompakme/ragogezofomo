Don't Forget Walmart!</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:492>Let's face it, who doesn't love a good bargain hunt at Walmart? You score rockin' deals on everything from the latest Fortnite Nerf blaster for your little gremlin (because let's be honest, they'll be begging for it) to that jumbo tub of cookie dough you totally intend to share (wink wink). But did you know you can <strong>maximize your savings</strong> with the <strong>Fetch Rewards app</strong>? That's right, it's like finding a twenty in the pocket of those jeans you never wear anymore – pure bonus points!</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:330>Here's the thing, though. Walmart isn't like some fancy, boutique store that fawns over your every purchase (although, wouldn't that be a sight?). With Fetch, Walmart works a little differently. But fear not, bargain hunter extraordinaire! This guide will have you navigating the aisles of digital receipts like a pro in no time.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=7:1-7:72>Step 1: Download the Fetch App (Unless You're Living Under a Rock)</h3><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:296>This might seem obvious, but hey, there's always that one friend who asks "you can get rewards for groceries?" ‍♀️ If that's you, download the Fetch app – it's free and available for both iOS and Android. Now you're ready to turn those receipts into virtual gold (or at least, gift card gold).</p><h3 data-sourcepos=11:1-11:78>Step 2: Walmart Doesn't Play That Paper Receipt Game (Well, Not Entirely)</h3><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:298>Here's the twist: Fetch doesn't currently accept physical Walmart receipts. <strong>But wait!</strong> Don't toss those crumpled beauties just yet. If you use Walmart's grocery pick-up or delivery service, Fetch can snatch those sweet, sweet <strong>e-receipts</strong> right out of your email. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.</p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:271><strong>Alternatively,</strong> you can link your email address to the Fetch app. This way, whenever you shop at Walmart (or any other supported store for that matter), Fetch will <strong>magically scan your inbox</strong> for receipts and snag those points before you can say "Walmart rollback."</p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:119><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make sure you enable email receipt delivery from Walmart for an extra layer of Fetch-friendly awesomeness.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=19:1-19:53>Step 3: Scan Those Digital Receipts Like a Boss</h3><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:278>Now for the moment of truth! Once you have your e-receipt or linked email working its magic, open the Fetch app and <strong>scan, scan, scan!</strong> The app will recognize the Walmart purchase and award you points based on the items you bought (because Fetch is super smart like that).</p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:179><strong>Bonus Round:</strong> Keep an eye out for special offers and bonus points on specific items. These can be a real game-changer, turning your weekly grocery haul into a points bonanza!</p><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:430><strong>There you have it!</strong> With these simple steps, you'll be a Walmart-Fetch master, racking up points and redeeming them for gift cards faster than you can say "checkout aisle." So next time you're stocking up on supplies for your upcoming apocalypse bunker adventure (because, let's be real, who doesn't have one prepped these days?), remember to Fetch those rewards and <strong>maximize your savings!</strong> Happy shopping (and Fetching)!</p>2024-01-19T06:19:06.441+05:30<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWtfnby4ecOoZKJlkZmxbsPApaSaqqRiwbB5zLJkn52kmLVuvsSwmKuco2O1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./explainer-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-register-for-the-next-n-power-batch.html><span>←</span><span>Explainer: Step-By-Step Guide on how to Register for the Next N-Power Batch</span></a>
