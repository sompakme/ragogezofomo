Everyone in the industry appears to have an opinion on it. However, it's clear that some of the people closest to the rappers involved have absolutely no interest in become either a target or an ally of future hate.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the Hawks appeared to reveal which side of the beef they, or at least their arena PA operator, were on as Minaj's "Big Foot" was heard at State Farm Arena prior to the team's game against the Lakers. The diss track, released last Sunday, was the most notable addition to the pre-game mix as fans entered the arena. The footage quickly went viral, with commenters online calling the PA operator "messy" as a result.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The song choice appeared to inspire Atlanta as the Hawks controlled the game wire-to-wire and came away with a 16-point win. Trae Young and Dejounte Murray combined for 50 points as the Lakers played without Anthony Davis. Austin Reaves led LA with 28 points while LeBron had 20. Once again under .500, the short-handed Lakers were able to bounce back with a win against the league-best Celtics later in the week.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
