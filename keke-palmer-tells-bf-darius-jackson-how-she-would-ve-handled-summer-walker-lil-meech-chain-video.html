Thankfully they've mostly handled it in stride, however, a recent situation clearly put some tension between them. Last week, yet another Instagram personality posted up wearing the BMF actor's chain, leading Walker to DM her for a quick interrogation session. While she told the R&B singer that she's never met Meech, and was given the chance to wear his necklace while hanging out with security, the woman later exposed the Florida native with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">more receipts</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Things certainly didn't look good for him, but the 23-year-old seems to have worked through the situation with Walker. We've seen them snapping selfies together as per usual in recent days, and while they're Over It, the internet isn't ready to stop talking about the hot gossip. During a recent chat with her boyfriend, Darius Jackson, and her mother, Keke Palmer revealed how she would've handled the situation in the mother of three's place. "She's not even getting on the line with me," the former child star responded when Jackson asked how his girlfriend would react to another woman wearing his Eagles jersey.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-keke-palmer-reacts-to-summer-walker-s-relationship-woes>Keke Palmer Reacts to Summer Walker's Relationship Woes</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I'm not talking to nobody," Palmer continued. "I don't care, she could be standing next to you in a picture. I'm blind, I'm Stevie Wonder to the bulls**t. Whatever we going through, we talking about that like... In the closet," she told listeners as her co-hosts cackled. When Keke's mom asked how she would react to another woman approaching her with allegations about her man being unfaithful, her daughter said, "And I saw your man! I didn't wanna bring it up, but since we bringing it up, have you checked with him? And then we'll laugh and move on because they'll know I'm not playing at that point."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As the clip comes to an end, Keke's mom drops a wise truth bomb – "You don't have to talk about your man or your money." If you were Summer Walker, how would you have handled the latest situation with Lil Meech's chain?
