We would love to know why it appears to be so different. At first, we thought perhaps it was the way the light is hitting the masks. Upon close examination it does appear that the one on RAW was a bit brighter and “cleaner” to a certain extent.</p><p>The mask is still awesome and Bray Wyatt is absolutely owning this new character.
