By adding the Levitate Music Festival to its portfolio, Live Nation continues to grow its concert offerings throughout the region.&nbsp;</p><p>Co-founded by Levitate Surf Shop owners Daniel and Jessica Hassett, in partnership with Thomas Cussins of Ineffable Music, the music and arts festival has quickly become a staple in this coastal Massachusetts community. What started in 2013 as a small celebration of local artists has quickly turned into a multi-day operation with upwards of 30,000 attendees. Held annually in July, the community-centric festival features roots, reggae, folk rock and funk music.&nbsp;</p><p>“Dan, Jess and their community have poured their hearts and souls into creating Levitate Music Festival, and we look forward to working with them to build this truly unique experience,” said Don Law, President of Live Nation New England. “They have exceptional instincts in crafting a remarkable event for their audience and we look forward to connecting even more fans and artists through this boutique festival experience.”&nbsp;</p><p>Added festival co-founders and Levitate Surf Shop owners Dan and Jess Hassett, “From the start we’ve strived not only to bring our community together, but also to share music and art with the world here in our own backyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ve admired and been friendly with Don and his staff at the New England Live Nation office for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’re honored to now have the opportunity to work alongside them officially as we work together to make Levitate the most unique experiential music and arts event on the East Coast.”</p><p>Levitate Music Festival is also focused on giving back to the community. Each year, a number of nonprofit partners are invited to attend the festival to spread awareness for their cause. The festival is also committed to environmental initiatives and donates $1 per ticket per day to the Boys and Girls Club of Marshfield, MA.&nbsp;</p><p>With more than 100 festivals in its global portfolio including Bottle Rock Napa Valley, Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Reading, Leeds, Governor’s Ball, Electric Daisy Carnival and more, Live Nation has one of the largest and most diverse platforms of festivals in the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ABOUT LEVITATE MUSIC AND ARTS FESTIVAL:</strong><br>Levitate Music & Arts Festival is a homegrown festival launched out of Levitate Surf Shop in 2013.&nbsp;Intended to bring together surf, music, and art communities, the boutique event has fast grown into the Northeast’s premier music & arts festival and now features 3 stages with national and local acts, over 100 artisans, environmental initiatives, and food trucks in a unique setting just 30 minutes south of Boston.
