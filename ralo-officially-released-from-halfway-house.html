Moreover, he posted a photo of a federal release notice form indicating that he was officially free from his stay at a halfway house (which lasted eight months) that same day. The Atlanta rapper and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">YSL sympathizer</a>, according to this revealed paperwork, will also face five years of probation following this release. "Today the last day of this federal halfway house s**t, I’m signing my papers we finna be outside…" he captioned his post. "#FukPrison #Fuk12 I’m ready to do my interviews, my shows call Johnnie (404) 798-0197."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For those unaware, Ralo saw a prison release in November of last year following a five-year prison sentence. Back in 2018, authorities arrested him after allegedly discovering $1 million worth of marijuana on his private plane at an Atlanta airport, and in June of 2022, he received an eight-year prison sentence. The judge credited this with four years of time served and, reportedly, with "one and a half year for good time," according to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the Thugger affiliate</a>. Since then, he stayed at the halfway house in Atlanta until just this week.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ralo-announces-his-freedom>Ralo Announces His Freedom</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition, Ralo also released some singles following his prison release, including a "First Day Out" and a couple of other collaborations. We don't know what's left in store for the future, but either way, fans are very happy with this development and are sending their best wishes. Unfortunately, this freedom also involved some bumps along the road, including <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a bizarre social media suspension</a> shortly after its lawful commencement. Presumably, this had something to do with his post-release terms restricting fan engagement.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the rap game welcomed Ralo back with open arms, as folks like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Baby</a> treated him to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"welcome home" gifts</a> like a $50K watch. It's been heartening to see, and though the process hasn't been perfect, that's an increasingly rare luxury. Hopefully the rest of his return to the regular world goes by without many hiccups. We'll see what this halfway house release provides in the future.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZ310hJNmqZqkn2Kzs7HEZp%2BapJasrrp5x6isrJ1dn66quIyrnKWdkaiybrTIqWShp6Biu6bD0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nike-air-foamposite-one-dmv-release-date-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Nike Air Foamposite One DMV Release Date Revealed</span></a>
