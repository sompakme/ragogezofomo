At the time, her 612-pound frame made doing daily tasks difficult and getting in and out of a car nearly impossible.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Getting out to the car should be two seconds, but it takes me like, ten minutes,” she said. Her mother, </span><b>Cris McKee</b><span>, was worried and added, “If Kirstin doesn’t take some dramatic steps to change her eating, she’s going to lose her mobility and be bed-bound. If I can’t get that door shut, then I don’t know what we’re going to do. I’m going to really have a hard time trying to get her out of this house.”</span></p><p><span>Luckily, with</span> <strong><a href=#>Dr. Nowzaradan Younan</a></strong><span>‘s help, she dropped 170 pounds and appeared to lose even more after her stint on the show ended.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After moving to Houston, Texas, in 2016, she relocated to Washington and has since kept a low profile on social media. Kirsten last posted a weight loss photo showing off her <a href=#>slimmer figure</a> in 2017 and fans raved over how wonderful she looked.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/My-600-Lb-Life-Kirsten-Perez-Keeps-Low-Profile-After-Impressing-Dr-Now-With-Weight-Loss-on-the-Show-02.jpg><p><span>During her time on the show, viewers saw how determined she was to transform her life, but there were some blockades on the road to getting there. On top of that, there were some old wounds she had to sort through.</span></p><p><span>The Washington resident revealed she had been gang raped when she was only 17, and Dr. Now told her he would discontinue weight loss treatment if she didn’t seek out the help of a therapist first. Eventually, she chose to accept this proposition.</span></p><p><span>“Let me be clear — you go to a therapist or there is nothing more I <a href=#>can do for you</a>,” he told her in episode 4. “Outside of a medical emergency, we are done. Do you understand me?” In a separate interview, he said, “This is not a good situation at all. I’m really disappointed right now in Kirsten … She needs a wake-up call.”</span></p><p><span>Kirsten agreed to see psychiatrist </span><b>Lola Clay</b><span>, who was able to help her open up about her past. “You have written a narrative in your mind where you’re just as culpable as the perpetrators,” Lola told Kirsten. “Let go of [the] responsibility … It’s important that you skew your thinking <a href=#>toward the positive</a>.” Lola linked Kirsten’s binge-eating to self-inflicted punishment stemming from the incident.</span></p><p><span>After losing more than 100 pounds following gastric bypass surgery, the bariatric surgeon praised Kirsten for sticking to the plan and said he was very proud of her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When preparation meets dedication, there’s always a greater chance of success!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJooqKqo6myr3nMsmRvaGBiuaN5y6KdnmWjmrJuw8eaq2asmJp6s7HApaCtsV2owaK%2BjKWmqKOjYrmqt8Rmq6icka56cn%2BWb2pxZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jody-raymond-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Jody Raymond Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
