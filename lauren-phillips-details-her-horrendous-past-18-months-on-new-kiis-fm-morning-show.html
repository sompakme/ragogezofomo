Lauren went on to talk about her marriage breakdown, the death of a close friend, her best friend’s little girl passing away and being on the borderline of having a nervous breakdown.</p><p>Asked if she was happy, Lauren said: “I thought I was happy and I went through a really hard time. My marriage broke down, I lost a really close girlfriend, one of my best friends had a little girl pass away. I had this really horrendous period, where I spent too much time caring for other people and just completely let myself go.”</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=1530ca9e9f1ebca42e80bcc423fe0157 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>Lauren Phillips’ ex-husband blasts her again</a></b></p><p>She added: “What I had is what I would say was a borderline nervous breakdown.</p><p>“I had Bells Palsy paralysis down my face. I woke up in the morning and had a coffee and it dribbled out of the side of my face out of my mouth”.</p><p>Jase asked if Lauren spoke to her ex-husband with Lauren revealing, “it didn’t end well. It was a really slow breakdown process”.</p><p>On what led to the breakdown, Lauren added: “We decided to buy a house, renovate a house, start a new business and get married at the same time, so there was this extensive pressure bubble we had put ourselves in, and there was a myriad of other issues playing along with that.”</p><p>Lauren added, “I’m confident that I am in a position where I can hold my head up high from that relationship.”</p><p>“I’m so grateful I’ve come out the other side. I’m really grateful to be given this opportunity... Getting this job has been the final cherry on top.”</p><p>In November last year, Lauren was trashed publicly by her ex-husband<a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=b67bf5ac11b6ba11ce485784cc1accfe data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev> Lachlan Spark in a lengthy Instagram post</a>.</p><p>Lachlan unleashed on Lauren in a post that accused her of “caring more about herself during their relationship.</p><p>He even stated that he “wasted” years of his life with her.</p><p>The post was also a way to debut his new girlfriend Courtney Wynbergen, who he said has “changed his world”.</p><p>“A while ago, I married a girl who cared much more about herself and how she was perceived than she did about me,” Spark wrote.</p><p>“It was a lot … too much, actually. I left and despite losing almost every friend I’d found over seven years (and a few other ‘best mates’ for good measure) in the blink of an eye, it was the best thing I’ve ever done.</p><p>“Approaching 40, I was more than a bit nervous I’d wasted a big chunk of my life with the wrong person, and that I was long odds to find anyone who was willing (or able) to give me the love I knew I deserved.</p><p>“I truly believed there was more to a relationship (and life) than skin-deep friends, free holidays and Instagram followers – I just needed to find it.”</p><p>He added: “And then, by sheer dumb luck, I ran into this girl, and my world changed. She’s the most considerate and understanding person I’ve ever known. She’s a risk taker and a rebel. She’s passionate, and she’s a fighter. She’s as sharp as a whip and she takes no prisoners.</p><p>“She’s loyal AF. She knows what it means to try. She doesn’t give a f**k what people think of her. And she knows how to love me like I’ve never been loved before.</p><p>“@courtswyn, you’re complex, complicated, deep, fierce, and utterly magnificent. Anything (and everything) but vanilla. I love you.”</p><p>Lachlan and Lauren got married in 2017 after they dated for six years. They split in November 2018.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Melbourne data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Melbourne</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmS%2ForDIqGalmaWnsq95z6GgpaSZpcBusMStmKKko2K1pr6MoaarqpWjsbDB0manmqukYn55ecyopa2go2S7psPSZqqtp6KufKOuk56bnpqTZ7NygpRxa5qZlGiAcbDEn2ecaWOas6V9</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacob-elordi-on-nate-s-moment-of-revenge.html><span>←</span><span>Jacob Elordi on Nate's Moment of Revenge</span></a>
