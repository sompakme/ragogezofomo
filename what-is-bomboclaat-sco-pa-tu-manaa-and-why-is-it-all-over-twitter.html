What does bomboclaat mean? It is possible that not everyone knows what it really means. Online users seem to be always creative. Apart from creating memes that trend, they also seem to come up with words that are sometimes meaningless, but then again the phrases tend to catch on and become more popular than expected.</p><h2>What is a Bomboclaat?</h2><p class=align-left>What does Bumbaclaat mean on Twitter? Just when people were trying to understand what Sco Pa Tu Manaa means, the popular phrase quickly finds its replacement. This exit marks the introduction of “Bomboclaat”: This is the new phrase everyone seems to be using on Twitter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f3f4492e41ab695f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Genevieve needs prayers to overcome what she is going through, not breaking news: Blogger SDK speaks</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What does it even mean? Do we know where it came from? Well, based on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Urban Dictionary, </a>the word is Jamaican and is a curse word used when surprised or angry. The source refers to it as an equivalent to the curse word, f**k.</p><p class=align-left>However, according to Know Your Meme, Bomboclaat can also be spelled Bumbaclaat, Bumbclaat or Bumbaclot. It is an expletive Jamaican Patwah slang word for a menstrual pad or toilet paper. The phrase is used as an insult or an interjection expressing disgust or anger.</p><p class=align-left>However, the phrase has been turned into a meme where people caption photos with it, and it means something completely different. A lot of people are confusing the viral phrase with Sco Pa Tu Manaa, but the two memes are slightly different.</p><h3>How did Bomboclaat become popular?</h3><p class=align-left>The Jamaican word which used to express shock or surprise appears to have captured no real attention when it was first used. It was later, when Rudeboy commented on how he came to Twitter to witness its misuse that people picked interest in it. He explained that it is an expression of shock that was quite unlike O jewa ke eng? which translates into “what is eating you up?” or “what is troubling you?” and Sco pa tu mana that is meaningless.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/da4ed800d56b622e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>From Toronto with love: Internet users amused over jumpsuit lady received and what she ordered</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Urban dictionary, on the other hand, describes it as a word that is used as a curse word and most used to place an emphasis on something. While Nigerians made <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the meme go vira</a>l on Twitter, Jamaicans came out to say that the Nigerians were using the word in a wrong context. They explain that other than using the word as a way of encouraging comments on their pics, there is a deeper meaning to it. Here are a few of their sentiments on twitter.</p><p class=align-left>Be schooled on the real meaning!</p><p class=align-left>Well, you can make fun of everything while at it.</p><p class=align-left>If you trace a little more, you will discover that the word came from Caribbean music. Any Caribbean music lover will notice that the word is often used at the intro of the most dance hall and reggae songs.</p><h3>What does SCO Tu Pa manaa?</h3><p class=align-left>Sco Pa Tu Manaa means what are your thoughts / share your opinions on the following picture.
