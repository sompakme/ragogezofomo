You are victorious never let them see you sweet (sic). Dust off your feet you can't bring old dust into new territory," she wrote. "Jesus was hated by many til this day they still hate him. We are not exempt. The higher you go the more demons you have to fight. The blessing of it all is you have the AMOUR OF GOD!!!!!"</p><p>Alsina expressed his gratitude for his mother, as well as the healing journey he's embarked on in recent years following his battle with liver disease and the controversy surrounding Jada Pinkett Smith, which was the center of his feud with Tory.</p><p>"I’m So thankful for the healing that God has brought to my mom and I’s journey. I could lose it all today, & THAT would still be the greatest remaining gift known to the name and soul of August.
