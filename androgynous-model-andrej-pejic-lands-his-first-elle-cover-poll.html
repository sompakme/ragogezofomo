The Serbian-born model has &nbsp;become the hot new It Boy/Girl in Europe, first walking both the men’s and women’s shows in 2011 for designer <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_jean-paul-gaultier data-tag=jean-paul-gaultier>Jean Paul Gaultier</a></strong> and the men’s shows for <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_marc-jacobs data-tag=marc-jacobs>Marc Jacobs</a>.</strong> In May 2011, Pejic’s cover for Dossier Journal — removing his shirt, his long blond locks in curlers — was considered so scandalous that the magazine had to be covered in Barnes & Noble and Borders bookstores.</p><p>Born in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1991, Andrej fled to Serbia with his family, settling in a refugee camp near Belgrade. Later, the family immigrated to Australia in 2000. He was discovered in Australia, in his teens, and was noted for his unique androgyny. He has become a muse to Gaultier and also is the face of one of the designer’s mens’ fragrances.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>STORY: Andrej Pejic Models Men’s and Women’s Clothing on Jean Paul Gaultier’s Runway</a></strong></p><p>Dressed entirely in Gaultier, the shoot features Andrej as both a man and a woman. Pejic’s feminine side shines in black lace lingerie and suspenders while his masculine persona <a href=# id=auto-tag_models data-tag=models>models</a> dark suits.</p><p>Pejic has also appeared in French Vogue and recently told New York magazine: “My gender is open to artistic interpretation. I don’t really have that sort of strong gender identity. I identify as what I am. The fact that people are using it for creative or marketing purposes, it’s just kind of like having a skill and using it to earn money.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>STORY: Hedi Slimane Named New Designer for Yves St. Laurent</strong></a></p><p>But like all models, staying slender is difficult. He told Grazia: “To do womenswear, I have to be disciplined. My waist has gone from 29 to 25 inches, my hips are 35 inches.”</p><p>But his androgynous bust served him well when he landed a gig modeling a push-up bra for a Dutch department store called Hema.</p><p></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvSrbClnV%2BWu6W%2BzqCwp6elqHquu8Oeo2aZnpm%2FpraMqZyjoZNiuaK6w6xkoaGjYrOqvtKtZJ6knJp6pLvVnqlmqJ%2BhuW6Aj3BrcGpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kenedi-anderson-dad-justin-anderson.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kenedi Anderson Dad Justin Anderson?</span></a>
