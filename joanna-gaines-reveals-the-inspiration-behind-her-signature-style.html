My <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://magnolia.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://magnolia.pxf.io/c/221109/1593884/18489?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmagnolia.com%2F" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=magnolia.com data-merchant-id=276883 data-merchant-url=magnolia.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad>Magnolia Boutique</a> was up and running, and I distinctly remember trying to figure out what my specific design style was. I found what I was looking for when Chip and I stopped in a small town on our way to the mountains of New Mexico,’ Joanna shares.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ydPjudAUG2MrEnyYosjC5-1920-80.jpg><p>The designer continues: ‘I saw farmland and silos – the lush green fields combined with the industrial galvanized cylinders, and chippy white paint spoke to me. From that point forward, everything I did from a design aspect was inspired from that picture in my mind’.&nbsp;</p><p>Touches of Joanna’s farmhouse style are visible in almost all of Joanna's designs, including in this rustic-chic living room from Fixer Upper (seen above). Many of Gaines’ designs include monochromatic wrought-iron light fixtures and hardware features that are a signature of the Waco-based expert.&nbsp;</p><p>These <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/spaces/decorating/modern-farmhouse-ideas-223803>modern farmhouse ideas</a> make for a striking contrast to the magnolia color palette Joanna favors, and pay homage to Joanna's memories of New Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p>However, while the designer revealed that memories of traveling sparked her <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/spaces/decorating/living-room-ideas-222997>living room ideas</a>, she is not alone.&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyTnmWdid2KD5a2CAvLWgU-1920-80.jpg><p>Martin Waller, Founder of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.andrewmartin.co.uk/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1623321&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.andrewmartin.co.uk%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homesandgardens.com%2Fnews%2Fjoanna-gaines-inspiration-for-signature-style" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - andrewmartin.co.uk" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Andrew Martin</a>, similarly shared an experience close to Joanna’s. While Mrs Gaines found her design inspiration in New Mexico, the founder of the global design label found his further east in Thailand.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Design has always been about more than just attractive patterns. It is about reflecting a personal view on a subject,’ Martin shared.&nbsp;</p><p>‘For me, this has often been about describing a love of various places or people. It was in Thailand that I first saw the miracle of silk yarn production and the laborious work of Ikat weaving, which can take a day to produce just a single meter,’ he adds.</p><p>These escapist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/decorating-ideas>decorating ideas</a> will bring hints of faraway shores to your living room, wherever you are in the world.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvMnqqappScrrOwxKeqZ5ufonyvsdasZqOnkaO7onnGmqCnnaNitq%2B%2Fz6KpmqyZpLtuss6rZKyhl6OutcHRnmSsrKmhsg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./incline-ez-bar-skullcrusher.html><span>←</span><span>Incline EZ bar skullcrusher</span></a>
