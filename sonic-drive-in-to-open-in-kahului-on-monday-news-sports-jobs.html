From the building’s architecture, independent local ownership, and the staff that serve our guests — each element proudly reflects the local community.”</span></p><p>Known for the carhops who bring food to customers in their vehicles, Sonic’s menu ranges from burgers to chicken tenders to hot dogs, along with sides like tater tots and chili cheese fries and drinks like its famous limeades.</p><p>As part of the opening, Sonic will debut its new teriyaki burger, which was developed exclusively for the Maui drive-in in partnership with Aloha Shoyu Company, according to the news release.</p><p>The new restaurant also features custom murals by Hilo artist Kristie Fujiyama Kosmides.</p><p>The Maui branch will employ more than 100 full- and part-time team members. It’s the first of several locations that Sonic is planning for Hawaii in the coming years.</p><p>To mark Sonic’s opening on Maui, the Sonic Foundation will make a $40,000 donation to fund the needs of Maui public school teachers through the brand’s longtime nonprofit partner, DonorsChoose, a platform that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom requests. Sonic also donates a portion of all drink, slush and shake sales to local public education through its Limeades for Learning initiative.</p><a href=#><img width=470 height=268 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/02/14064340/os-sonic-rendering-470x268.jpg alt decoding=async aria-describedby=gallery-4-1070245 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> A rendering shows the future outdoor seating area of Hawaii’s first Sonic Drive-In, which will open in Kahului on Monday.
