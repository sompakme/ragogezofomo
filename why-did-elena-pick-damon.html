After Elena lost her humanity, she taunted Damon, threatening to go back to Stefan since the sire bond was gone. However, <b>after she regained her emotions, she confessed her love for Damon, choosing him</b>.</span></span><h2>When did Elena fall in love with Damon?</h2>Elena's relationship with Damon changed when she became a vampire in season 4. She had drifted apart from Stefan as her feelings for Damon grew stronger, and during "My Brother's Keeper," the couple gave in to passion at last and slept together for the first time. This moment was highly anticipated for Delena fans.<h2>Does Elena eventually choose Damon?</h2>However, it also played a component in her eventually choosing Damon in The Vampire Diaries season 4, episode 23, "Graduation." As a human, Elena was more effectively able to compartmentalize her feelings for Damon, and prioritize her loyalty to Stefan. Once she was a vampire, however, her love was magnified.<h2>How did Damon fall in love with Elena?</h2>After saving Elena with Stefan in episode 8 of season 2, Damon shows up in Elena's room with the vervain necklace that was ripped from her neck earlier in the episode. Before he gives it back, he tells Elena that he is in love with her, and because he is in love with her, he cannot be selfish with her.<h2>Did Damon cheat on Elena?</h2>While Damon and Elena (Nina Dobrev) fans were dealt a pretty devastating blow in last week's episode, with Damon burning Elena's body and all, Damon drove the stake in the Delena fanbase's collective heart even further when he hooked up with someone else. Yep, it finally happened, and we were NOT happy about it.<h2>The Vampire Diaries 4x23 - Elena chooses Damon</h2><p></p><h2>Who did Elena choose in the end?</h2>It all built to the second half of the season finale, when Elena had to make a decision because she believed both brothers were hours away from dying. She had to choose which one got the goodbye. And ultimately, she chose Stefan.<h2>Is Elena in love with Damon because of the sire bond?</h2>Elena's emotions are turned off following Jeremy's death, and what's real and what isn't becomes even blurrier than before. It's not until the very end of the season that all is finally revealed. In a fan-favorite scene, Elena confesses her love for Damon after the sire bond is finally broken.<h2>Did Elena cheat on Stefan?</h2>Yes, Elena was unfaithful and disrespectful towards Stefan. Elena kissed Damon at the end of Season 2, when her and Stefan were STILL TOGETHER. No matter what that meant, it's cheating.<h2>Does Damon love Bonnie?</h2>Damon has also shown that he deeply and strongly cares for Bonnie and that he has a very deep and strong connection with her. He is shown to be very affectionate, gentle, loving and tender towards her and he is very overly protective of her.<h2>What episode does Elena confess her love for Damon?</h2>"Do You Remember the First Time?" is the 7th episode of the sixth season of the American series The Vampire Diaries and the series' 118th episode overall.<h2>Why did Elena break up with Stefan?</h2>When she escapes, Stefan goes after her to help her, but fails in stopping her from drinking Logan Fell's blood. Elena understands what Stefan is, and promises to keep his secret, but she explains to him that she can't be with him in the process and broke up with him.<h2>Does Elena choose Stefan or Damon in season 4?</h2>Season four ended with Bonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine the cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be killed. Elena had chosen Damon as the Salvatore that she loved, leaving a devastated Stefan.<h2>Why did Elena look different in season 8?</h2>They could've found a better one for the finale. The wig was awful. They should have bought a better one. It was parted differently and was higher up on her forehead which are two reasons why she looked different.<h2>Who does Elena have a baby with?</h2>Indeed, Stefanie Salvatore — as referenced during a Season 1 episode of The CW's Legacies — is the daughter of Elena Gilbert and Damon Salvatore, named in loving memory of the late, great Stefan.<h2>Why did Damon leave Elena?</h2>The episode ends with Elena and Damon fighting over their relationship and how much one depends on another. They decide to break up because their love makes them something else of what they really are but they end up in bed together because they cannot fight what they feel for each other.<h2>Who did Katherine love?</h2>Katherine fell in love with Stefan when she met him in Mystic Falls in 1864. Although she was also seeing Damon, she had a clear preference for Stefan. She secretly watched over him while running from Klaus.<h2>Was Elena jealous of Stefan and Caroline?</h2>While her emotions were switched off, she still got jealous when she saw Stefan and Caroline having fun together at a party she threw. So she first threatened Caroline's mom Liz, and then fought Caroline in the woods and would have killed her if Damon and Stefan hadn't stopped her.<h2>Who is the love of Damon's life?</h2>Elena Gilbert is Damon's girlfriend after season 4 and wife after season 8.<h2>What episode does Elena tell Damon she is pregnant?</h2>"Black Hole Sun" is the 4th episode of the sixth season of the American series The Vampire Diaries and the series' 115th episode overall.<h2>What episode do Elena and Damon sleep together?</h2>'The Vampire Diaries': Damon and Elena (Season 4, Episode 7) It was the moment Delena fans had been waiting for: Damon and Elena finally got it on.<h2>Did Bonnie and Damon kiss?</h2>After Elena won an argument with Damon, Damon told Bonnie that they kissed, leaving Bonnie shocked and giving Elena a quizzical look.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahsGacmZl6prjEp5hmqJmYuG6wwKampw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-mark-fleischman-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Mark Fleischman?
