The legendary rapper and singer was in charge of hosting the awards ceremony, making it back-to-back years. Last year, those duties were split amongst herself, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jack Harlow</a>, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>LL Cool J</a>.

According to Pitchfork, those included, Artist of the Year, Video of the Year ("Super Freaky Girl"), Best Hip-Hop ("Super Freaky Girl"), Best R&B ("Love in the Way" with Yung Bleu), and Best Visual Effects ("Super Freaky Girl").</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She did nab the Best Hip-Hop trophy to add to her prestigious list of accolades. Finally, she performed twice onstage to complete her jam-packed schedule. From previewing a new song from Pink Friday 2, to "Last Time I Saw You," and<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> joining hip-hop's finest for the 50th anniversary</a> of the genre, she really did it all. Queen Nicki's incredible work ethic is why so many female artists look up to her.

She says, "So proud of Nicki Minaj being the QUEEN looks so good on her & only fits HER [pink heart, teary eyes, monkey covering face, pink heart emoji] my sag sister I love her so much." She goes on to say that she was the first artist of her generation to publicly give support for Nicki and that she has never sided against her. Fans were not in agreeance with Doll saying, "she wanna be a soulja boy so badd üòÇüòÇ" Another says, "Girl bye you wanna be relevant sooo bad." It is quite the claim to make especially with artists like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a> and Coi Leray making music with her.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Asian Doll making the statement</a> that she was the first rapper of her generation to give Nicki Minaj her flowers?
