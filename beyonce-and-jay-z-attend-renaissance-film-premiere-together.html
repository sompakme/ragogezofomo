It spawned hit songs like "BREAK MY SOUL" and "CUFF IT" while also raking in praise from critics for its eclectic blend of influences. Earlier this year she took off on her massive Renaissance tour across North America and Europe. The tour made nightly news for the high-profile guests in attendance and various collaborators she had join her on stage.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this year after the tour wrapped up, she announced that a concert film recapping the shows would be released in December. It followed in the footsteps of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Taylor Swift</a>, who also turned the North American portion of her Eras Tour into a concert film that was released earlier this month. Now with the release of the Renaissance film coming later this week, the movie is being premiered at numerous locations around the world. Earlier this week the film had its North American premiere in Hollywood and the celebrities showed out. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lizzo</a>, Halle Bailey, and Lori Harvey were all in attendance and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">there was even a Destiny's Child reunion</a>. Now the film is having its London premiere which is once again stacked with guests.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-beyonce-and-jay-z-watching-renaissance-film>Beyonce And <a href=# class=text-word>Jay-Z</a> Watching Renaissance Film</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One person who showed up to the film's new premiere could certainly be considered a guest of honor. Jay-Z and Beyonce hit up the premiere together and pictures of the pair are circulating online. Much like earlier in the week, fans are once again asking some questions <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">about Bey's new blonde look.</a> Some fans are even going as far as to say that she looks unrecognizable or theorizing that she may have a body double of some kind.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Renaissance tour film is expected to have a massive opening weekend at the box office. Similarly, Taylor Swift's Eras Tour film earlier this year went out to massive numbers of its own. The film has already cleared $250 million across its first two weekends in theaters.
