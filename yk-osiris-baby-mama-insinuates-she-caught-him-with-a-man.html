Moreover, Stassia Thomas did not explicitly write this out or make a statement herself, so it's not set in stone. Rather, she reposted a tweet from a quotes page on her Instagram Story. While the rapper's most recent public contribution was an IG page calling out his <a href=# rel>fake Richard Millie watch</a>, this lit fans up. Even though many immediately criticized why this is an "insult" or clowned Osiris, others weren't as quick to draw conclusions.</p><p>"Stop asking me what happened with my [baby daddy]," the reposted tweet read. "I caught him with a man ok." The Story post isn't available anymore, but it quickly spread around social media as fans reacted. "Well she didn’t personally WRITE IT, she shared it from a quotes page," one user pointed out on The Neighborhood Talk's IG page. "Could be a joke insinuating don’t ask me about my BD. So I’ll wait until she comes out and says it herself." Of course, it's not the first time people tried to twist the rapper's sexuality <a href=# rel>for laughs</a>. Even if it's not a twist, what does it truly matter?</p><span><h2 id=h-yk-osiris-baby-mama-suggests-cheating-incident>YK Osiris' Baby Mama Suggests Cheating Incident</h2></span><p>Regardless, the Florida artist is usually one to laugh off controversies and treat his viral antics with a light-hearted tone. However, he made some concerning statements on IG Live last year that left many <a href=# rel>fearing for his happiness and mental state</a>. “If I killed myself right now, if I go right now, how would y’all feel?" he stated. "Nobody ain’t gon’ give a f**k…I’ma tell you what people gon’ say if I die right now…If I killed myself right now, they gon’ say, ‘Good, he don’t have to pay no more debts no more.’" Afterwards, many took to the comments to share encouraging and supportive messages, including <a href=# class=text-word rel>Big Sean</a>.</p><p>“Saying this outta love bro!" <a href=# rel>the Detroit rapper wrote.</a>&nbsp;"Love yourself first&nbsp;so you dont need everyone or anyone else’s love to function or to feel good. When you your own source of happiness n love then any love you get is just extra on top (which is beautiful) and any love you dont get, you’re still you and un affected, or at least not as affected by conditional circumstances or how others feel about you. Just leaving that here for others as well. Glad you feeling better though bro. God got you!” Following that dark moment, Osiris thanked fans for the support and said he's doing a lot better. Regardless, stay tuned to HNHH for more updates on this story and the latest on YK Osiris.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIVxhZdmsKRln6i2s7XSZpmamqliuqK5wGagp6uZo8KiwMSsZKyglWKwosHGoatmoJmieri106FkmmWdlrs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiffany-co-most-expensive-piece-in-history.html><span>←</span><span>Tiffany &amp;amp; Co most expensive piece in history</span></a>
