Those seemingly puny legs regularly withstand subzero temperatures.<h2>Are there non pink flamingos?</h2>Flamingos are known for their pink plumage, but not all flamingos are pink. The pink coloration comes from carotenoid pigments in the birds' diet. When flamingos have a diet lacking those pigments, the birds will be gray or white instead.<h2>Do flamingos have knees?</h2>According to Travis M. Andrews of the Washington Post, flamingos' unique skeletal structure helps them stay still while resting on one foot. Like humans, the birds have two main leg joints: the ankle and the knee. The bent crook of the leg that we can observe looks like a knee, but it is actually the birds' ankle.<h2>Why do flamingos turn blue?</h2>Carotenoids in crustaceans such as those in the flamingo diet are frequently linked to protein molecules, and may be blue or green. After being digested, the carotenoid pigments dissolve in fats and are deposited in the growing feathers, becoming orange or pink.<h2>Can a flamingo be a pet?</h2>No you can't. over a year ago.
