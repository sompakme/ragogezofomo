The 35-year-old has been rocking the red carpet since the nineties with that picture-perfect complexion - and it surely can't just be good genes (can it?!). Happily, the actress has finally revealed the product behind her super-clear skin: evening primrose oil. During a beauty session with makeup artist Lisa Eldridge, the star shared all about her favourite supplement. "For me, this is an incredible lifesaver when it comes to minimising blemishes and breakouts, particularly around hormonal times,' she said in a video on Lisa's Instagram Story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/66ae7160a738-kate-bosworth-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=esLNvkznPkL data-wc=9><strong>Kate is well-known for her smooth and glowing skin</strong></p><p id=eFIH0AH9trS data-wc=62>Even better, you can bag a bottle of evening primrose oil supplements for little over £10 - so the essential oil is a verified beauty bargain. Though the star did stress the importance of taking it consistently to see effective results, the oil is thought to boost skin with essential fatty acids, since it contains plenty of omega-6 (or gamma linolenic acid).</p><p id=eAM-SBr8dBO><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Why Kim Kardashian gets late-night facials</a></p><p id=efrozqIM3Bg><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb7eae564261-holland-barrett-natural-evening-primrose-oil-capsules-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=eQ_UkdjRjJCG data-wc=11><strong>The star has revealed she swears by Evening Primrose Oil supplements</strong></p><p id=eomjKGDAGanc data-wc=96>Kate's full makeup tutorial with Lisa is available to watch on YouTube, and is packed with tips from the two beauty gurus. At the beginning of the video, the actress revealed another of her favourite products, Epicuren's Aloe Vera Calming Gel, which she swears by applying before serum. "I have pretty sensitive skin, and this particular aloe is really very calming," she told the camera. "They've formulated it so even if you have an allergy to aloe vera, they took out whatever compound that creates that effect on the skin… and so it's just incredibly pure."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ec5ba03fe39f-kate-bosworth-skincare-favourites-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eH0C7HVyN7X9 data-wc=8><strong>Kate's other skincare favourites include Weleda and Epicuren</strong></p><p id=eA7Uzdo2qPpY><a class=hm-link href=#>READ MORE: All these celebrities have tattooed eyebrows</a></p><p id=eeiu5twup38D data-wc=73>The star also admitted that Weleda Skin Food is her moisturiser of choice when travelling. "I feel like I live somewhat on an airplane," she laughed, also explaining that living in the hot weather in Los Angeles can leave her skin dry. "A little amount goes a long way, but it feels exactly what the title of the product is - which is skin food." Sounds like it's time for a skincare update…</p><p id=ezr3I5MKq0DQ data-wc=14><strong>WATCH BELOW:&nbsp;2018 looks set to be a big year for celebrity beauty products</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGlpaWhlgHN%2Fk3Bpb25foK61sYybpqyvn6fBqXnBmqmgmZmjerS3yKeamqqVYsCmr9Geq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gratitude-by-brandon-lake-essential-worship.html><span>←</span><span>Gratitude by Brandon Lake, Essential Worship</span></a>
