Women in my clinic often speak of the difficulty of balancing careers and caregiving responsibilities, such as caring for children or older relatives, and how struggling to cope with menopause symptoms puts an additional strain on top of these existing challenges. You might have teenage children, who themselves are going through their own hormonal changes with puberty, which can put relationships under strain – as a mother to three daughters, I know first-hand what a juggle it can be!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/17780b2fbcf7-louise-newson.jpg><p id=e9CkqGNnSyk data-wc=37>“In past generations, menopause was seen as a taboo subject and as the end of a chapter in a woman’s life.

Understand the impact&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eUuR_BZuTOr data-wc=69>"Familiarise yourself with the various symptoms that the perimenopause and menopause can bring – forewarned is forearmed. You have hormone receptors throughout your body, so when levels of hormones oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone fluctuate and fall, this can trigger a whole range of physical and psychological symptoms, from low mood and anxiety, fatigue, brain fog, joint aches and pains, low libido as well as hot flushes and night sweats."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why does nobody talk about the incredible positives of menopause?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/dc21a2413207-ruby-hammer-image-2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why does nobody talk about the incredible positives of menopause?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why does nobody talk about the incredible positives of menopause?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=elkF5xPvJd data-wc=65>"Everyone’s menopause is different. You may not have any symptoms at all, or you may experience symptoms that impact your day-to-day life – what’s important is that you educate yourself so you can recognise changes related to menopause. My free<a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;balance menopause support app</a><strong>&nbsp;has</strong> lots of information and articles to get you started, plus you can track your symptoms if you are experiencing any."</p><h3 dir=ltr>2. Seek professional help if needed</h3><p id=e6gPMNVViv6 data-wc=76>"If you are experiencing symptoms, then it’s important to speak to a healthcare professional about the best treatment approaches for you. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the first-line treatment to ease menopause symptoms because it targets the underlying cause and replaces the missing hormones. Plus, it has benefits for your long-term health too. Women who take body identical HRT have a lower future risk of developing heart disease, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, clinical depression and dementia."</p><p id=eSqlF8IPkp data-wc=12><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Later life doesn't have to be boring – I'm living proof!</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>3. Adopt a holistic approach</strong></h3><p id=eDVFsN0jhbU data-wc=61>“It’s really important to take a holistic approach to managing your menopause, especially nutrition. You might be fatigued and so find yourself reaching for sugary or processed snacks to give you an energy boost. The odd treat in moderation is fine, but you really should be aiming for a diet rich in vitamins and nutrients to keep you energised and satisfied.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZwib6DHww data-wc=12><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Five smart ways to deal with perimenopause according to a nutritionist</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eGCtvRHc8p data-wc=127>"You could try doing a food cupboard audit or keeping a food diary for a couple of days and ask yourself is your diet as balanced and nutritious as it can be? What tweaks can you make to make the most of every meal? Variety is key, and following the principles of the Mediterranean diet, which is full of fresh ingredients and healthy fats, is a good place to start. Batch cooking is also a great way to keep a balanced diet on track. Life is so hectic these days, so I often make up a big batch of grains and veggies at the weekend and use that as the basis for lunches and suppers during the week, adding in my favourite proteins like fish or cheese.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/71a706e6bec8-shutterstock2362554261.jpg><h3 dir=ltr><strong>4. Consider your exercise regime</strong></h3><p id=eNvXkA4EMJpY data-wc=48>“Exercise is another important area to look at as it’s good for your bones, heart and mental health. If you haven’t exercised for a while, don’t put too much pressure on yourself to change everything all at once: start with some small achievable goals and build from there.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bef73d90ef07-midlife-stretch.jpg><p id=ed3bIFj_K4 data-wc=96>"This might be something as simple as trying to take a short walk every day or trying out a class with a friend (and a great way to turn it into a social activity). Find an activity that you enjoy, and you’ll be far more likely to stick to it. I’m not a huge fan of the gym or classes, but I love yoga: it helps me to focus, makes me strong and I love the fact I can just roll out my yoga mat in my room whether I’m at home or travelling for work."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="What midlife women want you to know about exercise" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1abdc2b17368-midlife-exercise.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="What midlife women want you to know about exercise" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>What midlife women want you to know about exercise</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3 dir=ltr><strong>5.
