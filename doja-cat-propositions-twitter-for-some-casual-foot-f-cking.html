Whether for <a href=# rel>shaving off her own</a> and replacing them with intricate designs over her eyes, or showing up to <a href=# rel>Paris Fashion Week</a> in some of the most outlandish looks we've ever seen, the recording artist knows how to keep the masses on their toes. While her <a href=# rel>wild fashion antics</a> are seemingly on pause for now, her Twitter fingers couldn't help but send out a salacious message on social media.</p><p>On Sunday (February 19), the "Say So" songstress continued her recent trend of sharing somewhat childish posts to her 5.5 million followers. Among previous uploads are "Everyone's a p*ssy," and the simple but always effective, "Butt." On the Lord's day, she switched things up a little, publicly inquiring, "Does anyone wanna come over and f*ck my foot?"</p><span><h3 id=h-doja-s-twitter-antics-continue>Doja's Twitter Antics Continue</h3></span><p>In the hours since posting, Doja's proposition has earned upwards of 41K likes and thousands of responses. Among the funniest replies are, "Raw, or do we have to use a sock?" and "Yes... Wait, no." Besides those seeing the humour in the situation, there are also hundreds of Twitter users making it known that they're on the verge of unfollowing the California native as a result of her antics.</p><p>Despite what the haters have to say, the Planet Her hitmaker has made it clear that the only person she cares about pleasing is herself. Since she's made a few <a href=# rel>changes to her personal style</a>, opting to embrace her ultra-creative side, some have begged Doja to return to her former <a href=# rel>conventionally attractive outfits</a> and makeup looks.</p><span><h3>Doja's Schiaparelli Serve</h3></span><p>Doja Cat attends the Schiaparelli Haute Couture Spring Summer 2023 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on January 23, 2023, in Paris, France.

"Felt like doing a pretty beat for you boring ass lemon water bitches out there," she wrote in an obviously salty Instagram post. "So you can shut the f*ck up now and leave me the f*ck alone, ciao."</p><p>Scroll further for more Twitter reactions to Doja Cat's latest outlandish tweets.
