Last week, the tourism board was rebranded as Experience Regina seeking to exploit the unfortunate similarity to the word “vagina” and have fun with a cheeky marketing campaign.</p><p>It was originally “Tourism Regina” but changed after a spoof tourism jingle that was played on the Jimmy Fallon <i>Tonight Show</i> in 2018, to viral acclaim.</p><p>To announce the new brand the tourism board released a music video featuring the song and promoting the “Queen City”.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Locals were not amused.</p><p>“Show us your Regina. Really. That’s the best we can do, female anatomy humour to promote our city?” wrote one dissatisfied Saskatchewan.</p><p>Others felt that it was a sign the city’s ratepayers had been taken for a ride and had been “ripped off” by the lazy marketing.</p><p>“Our city tourism board is going to be focused on REAL events to the exclusion of everything else and the misogynistic tone is very much lacking in class.

Merchandise printed by clothing company 22 Fresh, featuring the words “rhymes with fun”, were removed from stores and the company said they would be recycled.</p><p>The name “Experience Regina” however is here to stay.</p><p>First appearing on a spoof 2008 youtube video by the account Tourist Board Sask, the song <i>Experience Regina</i> continues to put it on the map.</p><p>Nearly 15 years on, the video has generated more than 700,000 views and the controversial advertising campaign hundreds of comments from proud Saskatchewans.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The top-voted response remains:</p><p>“This advert was a perfect balance of what Regina offers.
