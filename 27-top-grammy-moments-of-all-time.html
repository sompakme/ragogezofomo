<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>27 Top Grammy Moments of All Time</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On Sunday, the 66th Annual <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a> will take place at Crypto.com arena in Los Angeles. With performances by <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a>, <a href=#>SZA</a>, Dua Lipa, <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo</a>, <a href=#>U2</a>, Billy Joel, <a href=#>Joni Mitchell</a>, Burna Boy, Luke Combs and <a href=#>Travis Scott</a> — not to mention <a href=#>Trevor Noah</a> as host — anticipation is high for the yearly celebration of the best in music recordings, compositions and artistry. There’s also potential for more history to be made with Victoria Monét’s 2-year-old daughter, Hazel, already becoming the youngest nominee in Grammy Awards history as a featured artist on the singer’s song “Hollywood,” which is nominated for best traditional R&B performance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Of course, awards ceremonies are about more than just who takes home the big wins. There’s the <a href=#>red carpet</a> fashion, surprise appearances and those shocking, unscripted moments that set social media ablaze, which even the show’s producers and writers can’t prepare for as hard as they try. Since its inception on May 4, 1959, the Grammys have had plenty such instances, from stage crashers and last-minute performance changes and additions to acceptance speeches that serve as emotional calls to action and reminders of the hard work writers, producers, singers, songwriters and rappers put into their artistry. There’s also the meme- and GIF-worthy reactions to said moments that make watching the live event a true cultural phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As we await the 2024 Grammys, which will broadcast live Sunday, February 4, at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS and live and on demand on Paramount+, we take a look back at the moments in Grammy history that we wish we could’ve lived through, and the ones we’re glad we at least got to tweet through.&nbsp;</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>1973: Helen Reddy Refers to God as a Woman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/22-Helen-Reddy-Grammys-GettyImages-1158865650-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Though few would bat an eye at this declaration today, when Australian-American singer Helen Reddy referred to God in the female sense at the 15th annual Grammy Awards in 1973, people had quite a bit to say. In concluding her acceptance speech for best female pop vocal performance for her song “I Am a Woman,” Reddy said, “I would like to thank God, because She makes everything possible.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>1978: Barbra Streisand and Debby Boone Tie for Song of the Year</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/11.-Barbra-Streisand-and-Debby-Boone-tie-Grammys-1978-H-Split-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Though rare — but, perhaps, not as rare as you might think — Grammy ties can happen. The first time it occurred was in 1978 when Barbra Streisand’s “Love Theme from A Star Is Born” and Debby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life” were both named song of the year at the 20th annual Grammy Awards. As a co-writer of “Love Theme” with Paul Williams, Streisand added the songwriting award to her list of accolades while the award for “You Light Up My Life” went to writer Joe Brooks.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.4668639053254><h2>1984: Annie Lennox Performs as a Man</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/26-Annie-Lennox-Grammys-GettyImages-1039390828-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Imagine being a stage manager frantically looking for the talent that’s supposed to go on stage next and you think they’re nowhere to be found, yet you’re looking right at them. That’s what happened at the 1984 Grammys when Annie Lennox showed up dressed as a man and didn’t let anyone in on the ruse, including the show’s producers, who didn’t know what was happening until she walked out to perform “Sweet Dreams” with Dave Stewart. In a 2009 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>CTV News</a>, Lennox said of her decision that night, “There had been so much talk about my gender. Is she a man, is she a woman? And I said to Dave, ‘Let’s just do it like this, it’ll be such a laugh. I’ll take an old rumor and I’ll use it to show that everything is just performance.’”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>1984: Michael Jackson’s Record-Breaking Night</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1_GettyImages-1039390736-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At the 26th annual Grammy Awards, Michael Jackson set the record for the most Grammy wins in one night, taking home eight awards, including album of the year and record of the year. Sixteen years later, Santana became the only artist to tie Jackson’s record at the 42nd annual Grammy Awards in 2000.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>1985: Prince Shows He’s a Star</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/27-Prince-Grammys-GettyImages-1235604582-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">If the song title “Baby I’m a Star” didn’t convey the message, Prince and the Revolution’s live performance of the track at the 27th annual Grammy Awards in 1985 certainly did. The six-minute set marked the singer’s first time on the Grammy stage, and the energy was palpable as Prince asked the crowd “Do you want some more?” before hitting a dance break complete with eight back-to-back splits. At the end of the song, Prince walked off the stage through the crowd making as grand of an exit as he did an entrance.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>1990: Milli Vanilli Wins Best New Artist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20-Milli-Vanilli-Grammys-GettyImages-139215483-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In 1990, Milli Vanilli became the first — and to date the only — Grammy-winning artist to be stripped of their award. The pop due won best new artist for their album Girl You Know It’s True at the 32nd annual Grammy Awards. However, eight months later, the award was revoked by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences when producer Frank Farian admitted the pair didn’t actually sing on their album.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>1988: Michael Jackson’s Victorious Performance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2_GettyImages-1235320838-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When Michael Jackson’s album Bad failed to win in any of the categories it was nominated in at the 30th annual Grammy Awards, it was considered one of the biggest snubs of the night. Yet Jackson remained victorious, delivering what’s considered one of his best award show performances when took to the stage with a medley of “The Way You Make Me Feel” and “Man in the Mirror.” The L.A. Times called it “A dazzling and ultimately triumphant moment in Grammy history, one that overshadowed everything else on the program.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>1998: Aretha Franklin’s Impromptu Performance of "Nessun Dorma”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/13_GettyImages-51641072-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Aretha Franklin showed she’s more than the “Queen of Soul” at the 40th annual Grammy Awards when she sang an impromptu rendition of Italian composer Giacomo Puccini’s “Nessun Dorma.” The song was initially supposed to be performed by opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, who was set to open the ceremony in 1998. However, when he fell ill at the last minute, his good friend Franklin stepped in at the request of producer Ken Ehrlich, and received resounding applause from the audience.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>1998: Bob Dylan's Set Is Crashed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12_GettyImages-75949645-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 40th annual Grammy Awards delivered yet another memorable moment when three minutes into Bob Dylan’s performance of “Love Sick,” a shirtless man appeared next to him with the words “Soy Bomb” written on his chest. It turns out the crasher was an actor named Michael Portnoy who’d been hired to simply stand on stage and act like he was having fun during the set. Portnoy, however, a vegetarian at the time and, far from a Dylan fan, decided to go off script. “I knew I had to do some kind of intervention. That’s what I was into then, something completely unexpected,” he later said in an interview. The stunt got Portnoy escorted off stage and left in the shivering cold outside of Radio City Music Hall where the ceremony was held.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8><h2>1998: ODB Crashes the Stage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/14-Ol-Dirty-Bastard-Grammys-GettyImages-1204335285-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When Wu-Tang clan member ODB took the stage to receive Shawn Colvin’s award for song of the year at the 40th annual Grammy Awards, his beef wasn’t necessarily with the “Sunny Came Home” singer, but the Recording Academy, whom he felt snubbed the rap group twice that night after also losing to Diddy for rap album of the year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Please calm down, the music and everything,” ODB said as he took to the mic. “It’s nice that I went and bought me an outfit today that costed a lot of money today, you know what I mean? ‘Cause I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win. I don’t know how you all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children. We teach the children, you know what I mean? Puffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best, OK? I want you all to know that this is ODB, and I love you all. Peace!”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>2000: Britney Spears’ Memorable Medley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/21-Britney-Spears-Grammys-GettyImages-2366766-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Britney Spears has only hit the Grammy stage one time, but it was a performance to remember. In 2000, the pop singer performed a medley of two of her biggest hits, “Bottom of My Broken Heart” and “Baby One More Time,” complete with a wardrobe change, dance breaks and robot costumes that fans still talk about today.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>2000: J. Lo’s Iconic Versace Dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5_GettyImages-2279421-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On Feb. 23, 2000, Jennifer Lopez wore the dress that solidified her future as a household name. Walking the red carpet at the 42nd annual Grammy Awards, J. Lo wore a green silk chiffon Versace dress with a neck cut to her navel that would become one of the most talked-about designs of the luxury fashion brand. A replica of the dress is currently displayed in the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.4304677623262><h2>2001: Elton John and Eminem Perform Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4_GettyImages-51589628-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">News of Eminem’s appearance at the 43rd annual Grammy Awards sparked protests from audiences and organizations like GLAAD, which had deemed the rapper’s third album, The Marshall Mathers LP, to be homophobic and riddled with hate speech. That made Elton John’s decision to perform the single “Stan” with Eminem at the 2001 ceremony all the more shocking.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On receiving the invitation from the Detroit native to perform with him, John told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>L.A. Times</a>, “I’m a big fan of his music, and I said I would be delighted to. I know I’m going to get a lot of flak from various people who are going to picket the show, [but] I’d rather tear down walls between people than build them up.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>2001: Toni Braxton’s Little White Dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6_GettyImages-87855511-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Toni Braxton upped the sexy precedent set by J. Lo in 2000 with a white Richard Tyler Gown that left little to the imagination at the 2001 Grammy Awards. The singer told People of her dress of choice, “I’ve always gone a little risqué with all my other awards. I decided that before I got married and had babies, I’d wear this.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>2002: All the Ladies of “Lady Marmalade” Hit the Stage Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/10_GettyImages-2367258-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When Pink, Mya, Lil’ Kim and Christina Aguilera teamed up for a remake of “Lady Marmalade,” produced by Missy Elliott for the soundtrack of Moulin Rouge in 2001, it was an instant hit. The song was first made popular by LaBelle in 1974, and at the 2002 Grammys, the funk group’s front woman, Patti LaBelle, joined the ladies on stage to perform the song for what’s been considered one of the greatest female collaborations of the 2000s.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.8150289017341><h2>2005: Melissa Etheridge Performs After Breast Cancer Treatment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/15-Melissa-Etheridge-Grammys-Performance-GettyImages-88040921-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In 2005, Melissa Etheridge joined Joss Stone in a tribute to Janis Joplin at the 47th annual Grammy Awards. The rock singer, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2004, was finishing up chemotherapy treatment and appeared bald on stage as she performed. Of her decision, she later told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a> in a 2014 interview, “I felt it was an opportunity for me to step back into what I loved to do. I mean, 10 years ago when you were diagnosed, people thought, ‘That’s it, she’s out of here,’ you know? So I wanted to show people that no, I’ve been through hell, yeah, this is awful, but I am not dying. I wanted to present myself as, ‘I’m back, I’m not weak, this has made me stronger.’ I just didn’t want anyone to make fun of me.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>2008: Tina Turner and Beyoncé Perform “Proud Mary”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3_GettyImages-79696349-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Beyoncé is usually the one making newer artists dream collaboration come true, but in 2008 she got the chance to take the stage with her own idol, Tina Turner. The singers performed a customarily energetic rendition of “Proud Mary” in complementary silver metallic outfits at the 50th annual Grammy Awards to raving applause from the audience.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>2009: M.I.A. Performs While Having Contractions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/16-M.I.A.-Grammys-Performance-GettyImages-84706975-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">M.I.A wasn’t going to let anything stop her from performing at the 51st annual Grammy Awards, not even labor. The then-pregnant British rapper not only performed on her due date, but she began having contractions just as the show began that evening. Deciding the show must go on, M.I.A. didn’t miss a beat performing “Swagga Like Us” alongside Jay-Z, Kanye West, Lil Wayne and T.I., and she gave birth to a healthy baby boy three days later.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.898916967509><h2>2010: Pink Soars Through the Air</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/17-Pink-Grammys-Performance-GettyImages-98749564-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For her first solo Grammy performance, in 2010, Pink decided to fly high. The singer performed her song “Glitter in the Air” from above the crowd, spinning in aerial silks as she belted out the lyrics. She said of her trapeze act in an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>, “It feels like after 10 years people still don’t know what I do. [The song is] very spiritual and it’s very sensual and it’s very sophisticated and visually beautiful, so I just wanted to really show up.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9522184300341><h2>2011:&nbsp;Lady Gaga’s Egg Entrance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7_Lady-Gaga-The-53rd-Annual-GRAMMY-Awards-Split-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Lady Gaga made the grandest of entrances at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards in 2011 when she was carried down the red carpet inside of an egg. Prior to the performance of “Born This Way,” the singer <a href=#>spent 72 hours</a> inside of the prop she later clarified was a “vessel.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It was time for me to really prepare and think about the meaning of the song and get prepared for the performance,” she said on Ryan Seacrest’s KIIS-FM radio show. “I really wanted to be born on stage.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>2012: Jennifer Hudson’s Whitney Houston Tribute</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/18-Jennifer-Hudson-Grammys-Performance-GettyImages-138859778-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 54th annual Grammy Awards took place the day after Whitney Houston was found dead in her hotel room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Feb. 11, 2012.

Admittedly inspired by the ‘70s horror film The Exorcist, Minaj’s live rendition of “Roman’s Revenge” and “Roman Holiday” featured an exorcism that led to her levitating above the crowd, all while hooded priests danced across the stage. The Catholic Church was none too happy with the rapper’s visual representation, yet when asked about the response to her set on a red carpet days after the show, Minaj replied, “I don’t know, what is the big issue?”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>2014: Queen Latifah Officiates 33 Weddings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/19-Queen-Latifah-Grammys-GettyImages-465337497-H-2024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Creating a Grammy first is hard for an award show that’s been in place since 1959, but Queen Latifah did just that when she officiated the wedding of 33 couples during the 56th annual ceremony in 2014.

The Lemonade album, Beyoncé, was so monumental, and so well thought out, and so beautiful and soul-bearing.
