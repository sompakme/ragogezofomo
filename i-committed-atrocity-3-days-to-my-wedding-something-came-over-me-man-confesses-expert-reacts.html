Open up to her</h2><p class=align-left>You just committed an atrocity, and you need to confess to her. Be accountable for your actions. You did not only cheat, and you slept with an ex! That's the height of disrespect.</p><p class=align-left>If you feel an iota of respect for your woman, tell her about it. Tell her what you did and be ready to bear the consequences of your actions.</p><h2>2. Be ready to postpone/cancel the wedding</h2><p class=align-left>It's just three days to the <a href=#>wedding</a>, and it's such a short time for her to heal after you might have opened up about your atrocity.</p><p class=align-left>So please be ready to postpone or cancel the wedding immediately. Whichever way she chooses, the decision is hers. A marriage built on a lack of trust and deceit is not worthy. Tell her, be accountable, and obey whatever step she takes to heal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3f3a9c45027d2edc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man leaves lady in pain for bringing 2 of her friends to their beach date, people react</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She may or may not postpone the wedding.

Cut ties with your ex</h2><p class=align-left>Leaving a <a href=#>relationship</a> doesn't mean becoming enemies, but clear boundaries should exist.</p><p class=align-left>I don't see why you should see your ex three days before the wedding. That's where he messed up. Boundaries were crossed or not even set in the first place. It would be best if you cut ties with such an ex who would agree to sleep with you knowing you have a wedding at hand.</p><h2>4. Genuinely ask for forgiveness</h2><p class=align-left>Ask your woman for forgiveness. You committed a grave level of offence. You betrayed the <a href=#>love you</a> share, the trust, everything.</p><p class=align-left>Genuinely apologise for your wrongdoings and let it also show in your actions that you are ready to make amends.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fb1b1f7a4bb8ab7b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man considers 'flinging' girlfriend away after seeing her TikTok comment, people react</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Disclaimer: The advice in this article is general and not intended to influence readers' decisions about relationships.
