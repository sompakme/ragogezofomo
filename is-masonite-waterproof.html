Masonite composite hardboard has a natural moisture resistance that makes it ideal for outdoor use. When Masonite is installed, the area of the hardboard pierced by a fastener has the potential to absorb moisture. Masonite should always be waterproofed after installation in order to prevent structural failure of a piece of Masonite that has been successfully placed.

The term “tempered hardboard” refers to hardboard that has been baked after being treated with linseed oil."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

When Masonite is installed, the area of the hardboard pierced by a fastener has the potential to absorb moisture. Masonite should always be waterproofed after installation in order to prevent structural failure of a piece of Masonite that has been successfully placed.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3><b>Is tempered Masonite, on the other hand, waterproof?</b></h3><p>The term “tempered hardboard” refers to hardboard that has been baked after being treated with linseed oil. Water resistance, impact resistance, hardness, stiffness, and tensile strength are all improved with this coating. Above all else, both hardboard and masonry are not water-resistant materials.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>Second, is Masonite a potentially hazardous substance?</b></h3><p>&nbsp;According to the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission [NOHSC:1008(1999) and NOHSC:10005(1999)], this product in its intact condition is not categorised as hazardous, however the dust generated by this product is classified as hazardous.</p><p></p><h3><b>Also, do you know whether Masonite can be used outside?</b></h3><p>In the absence of any treatment, peg board (with or without the holes; also known as: press board; fiberboard; particle board; masonite) will survive outdoors for around 2.5 days before becoming worthless for any purpose.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>What happens when Masonite is exposed to moisture?</b></h3><p>When Masonite is installed, the area of the hardboard pierced by a fastener has the potential to absorb moisture.
