So I said, 'Don't do anything more to that, let me go write something,' so I wrote it out in a few minutes and we had the song."</p><p class=paragraph-text>He added: "Interesting thing about 'Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word' is that it's one of the rare occasions when Elton played me a melody line that inspired a lyric, as opposed to our routine of the lyrics always coming first.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He was messing around on the piano one day and was playing something and asked me what did I think. It was actually pretty immediate, the title and the first couple of lines came into my head in a way that I guess I felt they were already there and just needed a little prompting."</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=8><h2 class=title>'Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word' meaning: What is the song about?</h2><p class=paragraph-text>The song is a mournful ballad about a romantic relationship which is falling apart.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Taupin said: "It's a pretty simple idea, but one that I think everyone can relate to at one point or another in their life.
