Three months later, U.S.-China relations were normalized, a top priority for <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=5>Brzezinski</span>. He also had a hand in two other controversial agreements: the SALT II nuclear weapons treaty with the Soviet Union and the Panama Canal treaties ceding U.S. control of the waterway.</p><p>“He was brilliant, dedicated and loyal,” said Carter, who awarded <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=9>Brzezinski</span> the Presidential Medal of Freedom days before leaving office in 1981.</p><p><span data-scayt_word="Brzezinski's" data-scaytid=11>Brzezinski’s</span> death at age 89 was announced on social media Friday night by his daughter, MSNBC host Mika <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=12>Brzezinski</span>.

In the <span data-scayt_word=1960s data-scaytid=35>1960s</span> he was an adviser to John F. Kennedy, served in the Johnson administration and advised Hubert Humphrey’s presidential campaign. He was the first director of the Trilateral Commission, an international discussion group, serving from 1973 to 1976.</p><p>In December 1976, Carter offered <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=36>Brzezinski</span> the position of national security adviser. <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=37>Brzezinski</span> had not wanted to be secretary of state because he felt he could be more effective working at Carter’s side in the White House.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=40>Brzezinski</span> often found himself in clashes with colleagues like Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. For the White House, the differences between Vance and <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=41>Brzezinski</span> became a major headache, confusing the American public about the administration’s policy course and fueling a decline in confidence that Carter could keep his foreign policy team working in tandem.<br>The Iranian hostage crisis, which began in 1979, came to dramatize America’s waning global power and influence and to symbolize the failures and frustrations of the Carter administration. <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=44>Brzezinski</span>, during the early months of 1980, became convinced that negotiations to free the kidnapped Americans were going nowhere. Supported by the Pentagon, he began to push for military action.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Carter was desperate to end the standoff and, over Vance’s objections, agreed to a long-shot plan to rescue the hostages. The mission, dubbed Desert One, was a complete military and political humiliation and precipitated Vance’s resignation. Carter lost his re-election bid against Ronald Reagan that November.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=47>Brzezinski</span> went on to ruffle the feathers of Washington’s power elite with his 1983 book, Power and Principle, which was hailed and reviled as a kiss-and-tell memoir.<br>“I have never believed in flattery or lying as a way of making it,” he told The Washington Post that year. “I have made it on my own terms.”</p><p>The oldest son of Polish diplomat <span data-scayt_word=Tadeusz data-scaytid=88>Tadeusz</span>&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=49>Brzezinski</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Zbigniew data-scaytid=50>Zbigniew</span> was born on March 28, 1928. He attended Catholic schools during the time his father was posted in France and Germany. The family went to Montreal in 1938 when the elder <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=54>Brzezinski</span> was appointed Polish consul general. When Communists took power in Poland six years later, he retired and moved his family to a farm in the Canadian countryside.</p><p>At his new home, the young <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=56>Brzezinski</span> began learning Russian from a nearby farmer and was soon bitten by the foreign policy bug.</p><p><span data-scayt_word="Brzezinski's" data-scaytid=58>Brzezinski’s</span> climb to the top of the foreign policy community began at Canada’s McGill University, where he earned degrees in economics and political science. Later at Harvard, he received a doctorate in government, a fellowship and a publishing contract — for his thesis on Soviet purges as a permanent feature of totalitarianism.</p><p>He made frequent trips to Eastern Europe and wrote several books and articles on Communism in the <span data-scayt_word=1950s data-scaytid=60>1950s</span>. Throughout his career, he would be affiliated with moderate-to-liberal groups, including the Rand Corp., the Council on Foreign Relations, Amnesty International and the NAACP.</p><p>Cautioning in lectures of fractures within the Communist movement, <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=61>Brzezinski</span> emerged in the <span data-scayt_word=mid-1960s data-scaytid=63>mid-1960s</span> as a defender of the American presence in Vietnam. Unless the United States put up an effective resistance there, he argued, communist nations such as China would be emboldened to engage the West by fomenting trouble in politically unstable regions.<br>Still, <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=64>Brzezinski</span> characterized himself as a “<span data-scayt_word=dawk data-scaytid=66>dawk</span>,” suggesting that he might have had reservations about other aspects of American policy in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Impressed nonetheless, the Johnson administration appointed him to the State Department’s Policy Planning Council in 1966. Though he was low on the White House totem pole, the position gave <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=67>Brzezinski</span> <span data-scayt_word=entre data-scaytid=69>entre</span> to the highest circles of White House decision-making.</p><p>After Carter left office, <span data-scayt_word=Brzezinski data-scaytid=70>Brzezinski</span> returned to lecturing, writing and serving on commissions, boards and task forces. He took part in the long-awaited reunification of Europe as a delegate to proceedings designed to bring the former Soviet republics into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p><p>“It was a triumph for the allies, he said, over a brutal secret non-aggression deal hatched during World War II — “the final undoing in Europe of the legacies of the Stalin-Hitler pact.”<br>He remained engaged and opinionated, tweeting for the last time early this month:</p><p>“Sophisticated US leadership is the sine qua non of a stable world order. However, we lack the former while the latter is getting worse.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeql7aousiermaaoq%2Byu7XNrKKiZZSarqV5wpqprZ2iYruiwMiopZqkXaiypMHRoquyZZGZw6q%2FxKtkn5mknbKzecyiopplkqfHpsbIp6qkoV2Ztqa%2FjJqrZnBpYn5xfJdrbm9n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./artist-attempts-to-paint-every-person-living-in-st-davids-wales.html><span>←</span><span>Artist attempts to paint every person living in St Davids, Wales</span></a>
