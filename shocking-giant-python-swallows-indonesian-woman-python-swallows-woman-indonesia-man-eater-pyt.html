Some 100 residents, including worried relatives, launched a search for the woman after she failed to return from her garden Thursday night.</p><p>Hamka said villagers found the giant serpent lying about 30 metres from Tiba's sandals and machete, adding she was swallowed head first and her body was found intact.</p><p>The garden in which she disappeared was at the base of a rocky cliff, pockmarked by caves, and known to be home to snakes, Hamka added. Giant pythons, which regularly top six metres, are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines.</p><p>While the serpents have been known to attack small animals, attempts to eat people are rare. In March last year, a farmer was killed by a python in the village of Salubiro on Sulawesi island.</p><p><b><a href=#>Read more world news</a></b></p><ul class=tipPop><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.onmanorama.com/etc/designs/malayalam/clientlibs/img/tweetshare.png id=shareTW width=20 height=16 alt="alt text" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></li></ul>×<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmp52nqHy4u9Glm2hqYGaFcHyVaGhvZ6Cuwam7zWaqsJmcoby4v4yipZ2nnprAqq3NZq6opZGje6nAzKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quinton-anderson-reynolds-sibling-meet-deidra-hoffman.html><span>←</span><span>Quinton Anderson Reynolds Sibling: Meet Deidra Hoffman</span></a>
