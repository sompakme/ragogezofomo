Of those, breast lifts were in the top five surgical treatments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We asked two plastic surgeons to weigh in on the treatment to understand what the surgery involves, what recovery looks like, potential side effects, results, and more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-does-a-breast-lift-procedure-involve></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Does a Breast Lift Procedure Involve?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A breast lift procedure is probably better explained as a breast shape improvement procedure, explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Steven M. Levine, MD</a>, a Manhattan-based plastic surgeon. "The nipple is elevated to a more favorable position and the skin envelope around the breast is tightened so the breast appears more youthful, denser, and in a higher post."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-should-one-consider-a-breast-lift-over-a-breast-augmentation></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When Should One Consider a Breast Lift Over a Breast Augmentation?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite them being two completely different procedures, the answer isn't always straightforward. "This is complicated," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Stafford Broumand, MD</a>, a board-certified plastic surgeon at 740 Park Plastic Surgery. "Patients who have sagging that cannot be corrected with just an augmentation always have the option to lift the breasts and put an implant in for added volume if that is their aesthetic goal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Levine also notes that, usually, breasts appear smaller after a lift procedure. So, if patients don't want to lose volume or want to add some, a breast augmentation would be a better option. "This procedure can also have a lifting effect on the breast," he confirms.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-is-a-good-candidate-for-a-breast-lift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Is a Good Candidate For a Breast Lift?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Broumand says that anyone who has sagging/ptotic breasts. "[It] can be genetic, from weight loss or gain, post-pregnancy and breastfeeding, or natural aging," he explains. The typical demographic for a breast lift patient is a woman who is finished having children and wants to get the shape of her pre-children breast back, according to the President of The Aesthetic Society, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>William P. Adams, Jr., MD</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Dr. Levine says that anyone who would like to change the shape of their breasts without adding volume is a good candidate, and ideally, they're a non-smoker. "Some women are born with more laxity in their breast tissue than others and would be happier with a tighter, higher breast, even without having been pregnant," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And if you're curious about when people decide to opt for a breast lift, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2020 study</a> by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons that broke down the patients' demographic by age found that 18% are between the ages 55-69, 40% are between 40-54, 27% are 30-39, and 11% are aged 20-29.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: This Non-Invasive Treatment Can Give You a Permanently Sculpted Jawline in Just a Few Months</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-potential-side-effects-from-breast-lifts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are There Potential Side Effects From Breast Lifts?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Any procedure or professional treatment aways comes with a risk. However, Dr. Levine says that minimal scarring could occur, and Dr. Broumand says it could result in decreased nipple sensitivity. He also says that there's a chance the surgery can reduce a woman's ability to breastfeed, but that there's no scientific data to back that up. "I just think the warning is important," he explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-does-recovery-from-a-breast-lift-look-like></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Does Recovery From a Breast Lift Look Like?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Levine says that breast lifts cause very little pain and that patients typically feel well within one to three days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"After their two-week follow-up, patients are generally allowed to resume some low-impact exercise, at four weeks a normal gym routine, and by six weeks they generally do not have any restrictions," says Dr. Broumand.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-does-a-breast-lift-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much Does a Breast Lift Cost?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with every plastic surgery and in-office treatment, the price varies dramatically depending on geographical location and practitioner. Dr. Broumand says that breast lifts are typically pricier than breast augmentations, and Dr. Levine says they can range anywhere between $10,000 and $40,000 depending on what exactly is being done and who is doing it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BzscCsq2akmZvBtA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-the-2024-met-gala-looks-from-zendaya-to-jennifer-lopez.html><span>←</span><span>All the 2024 Met Gala Looks, From Zendaya to Jennifer Lopez</span></a>
