The singer revealed that she'd be lying if she said she didn't pay attention to criticism on Twitter, but she tries not to take it to heart. "Anytime I go on Twitter there's always the good, but the bad as well," Rita said. "<strong>I try to just blank out what I don't want and take in what I wanna keep</strong>. I'm ready for the ups and downs, but for me there's only ups. The 24-year-old also revealed that she plans to be an "open book" on the BBC show.</p><p id=euR3rM_vBhDS></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/32ffbc2e9dd2-rita-z.jpg><p id=eGwbU5BSxX5O data-wc=11><strong>Rita Ora has said she tries to "blank out" Twitter critics</strong></p><p id=eYdFZCcO5bVr data-wc=115>"People only see pictures of me, my music videos and interviews there and again, so I said to myself I can only be myself," she revealed at the launch event. Rita, who is <a class=hm-link href=#>currently dating rapper Ricky Hil</a>, also made it clear that her openness will even extend to letting contestants know when she finds them attractive. "<strong>For me it's not about the flirtiness, that word has been used a lot</strong>. It's more about cracking the ice, and I always try to make people feel comfortable so they can achieve what they want to achieve in the audition. "I know that they’ll thank me! They may get a bit red in the face at first but they'll thank me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1b1a0280c13f-thevoice-z.jpg><p id=eKt4WfA7Y1rB data-wc=12><strong>Sir Tom Jones said that Rita brings "something new" to the show</strong></p><p id=egLpfc6asDDg data-wc=180>Rita joins Will.i.am, <a class=hm-link href=#>Sir Tom Jones</a> and Ricky Wilson as a coach for series four of the BBC singing competition, and has obviously made an impression on her colleagues, with Tom saying that she brings "something new" to the show. "It's nice to have a new face as well because it lifts us up, it's about that personality you have to work with and she fits the bill perfectly," revealed Tom. With her new coaching role on and <a class=hm-link href=#>a role in the new Fifty Shades of Grey movie</a>, 2015 looks set to be an incredible year for the Kosovan-born star, and she is clearly excited about the&nbsp;upcoming projects. "There's a few movies coming out next year, and we'll have this () which is what today is about," she revealed. "I try to keep things separate because for me and the reason that I joined it is to support what it is, and I use all my other things as promotion. "The movies, my new album, my clothing line, Rimmel and my perfume…<strong>basically just hurry up with 2015!"</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
