Ninalowo and his wife were exercise buddies</h2><p class=align-left>Looks like having gone their separate ways, the couple would have to look for new gym buddies, but we <a href=#>can</a> bet it would never be the same. Nigerians particularly loved how the muscular actor carried his wife along on his fitness journey, ensuring she stayed fit and in shape. Most videos of the couple working out eventually turned into a <a href=#>loved-up moment</a> as they shared kisses and hugs.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Share your outstanding story with our editors! Please reach us through info@corp.legit.ng!</p><h2>2. Maka and his wife give their kids a fashion show</h2><p class=align-left>A lot of people used to gush over how well put together <a href=#>the actor's kids</a> looked in their outfits, but the ultimate slay were the parents. Most times, the actor and his wife would step out to places rocking matching or coordinating outfits and stealing the shine from their two kids. Ninalowo made sure his wife complemented him in every way.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/205a073ad11e8053.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Steve Harvey, wife Marjorie deny rumours she cheated with bodyguard: "Foolishness and lies"</span></p></a><h2>3. Bolanle Ninalowo and his wife slay in trad fits</h2><p class=align-left>Even though the couple mostly turned up in regular outfits, fans used to look forward to their traditional shoots. Their coordinated outfits and regal appearance generated a lot of 'God when', probably running into millions. Ninalowo and his wife <a href=#>complemented each other</a> way too much, and seeing them with other people might not look that great.</p><h2>4. Ninalowo and his wife were like teenagers in love</h2><p class=align-left>Despite being married for over a decade, it was evident in photos and videos that the couple adored each other. Ninalowo would hold his wife, carry her and even play with her like they used to when they were younger. Videos like these were one of the many that gave people hope that genuine love exists.</p><h2>5. Bolanle Ninalowo never took the spotlight alone</h2><p class=align-left>One quality many Nigerians admired about the actor was that he never took the praise or the shine alone. Ninalowo was always quick to show off his wife and share their moments on social media. The actor also made sure he expressed how much the mother of his <a href=#>two adorable kids</a> meant to him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ae603a72a3e00231.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cute photos emerge as secondary school sweethearts get married years later, prove people wrong</span></p></a><h2>6. Maka and his queen</h2><p class=align-left>The couple were a photographer's delight. Every photo of them reeked of love, and it must have been effortless getting them to hold hands and gaze into each other's eyes. Bolanle Ninalowo is fondly called Maka, and he made it known several times that his wife comes first as the queen of the Maka kingdom.</p><h2>7. Ninalowo and his wife, the real Barbie and Ken</h2><p class=align-left>The original Barbie and Ken might be reigning in pink, but Ninalowo and his wife ruled in other colours. The actor and his wife used to step out like Gen Z kids, refusing to let their ages define how they should look. It would have been interesting to see how much of a power couple they would have been in years to come.</p><h2>Charles Okocha and Bolanle Ninalowo battle with accents</h2><p class=align-left>In other news, there was a <a href=# title>clash of accents </a>and a show of power in skit maker Mr Macaroni's video featuring actors Charles Okocha and Bolanle Ninalowo.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9e5205564f84fa71.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Georgina Onuoha demands release of 100 arrested crossdressers in Delta: "They didn't steal or harm anyone"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the hilarious clip, Macaroni's on-screen wife, Mummy Wa, was being harassed by Okocha, who fancied her. He tried to get her to go with him as he spoke in a hilarious American accent.</p><p class=align-left>]Ninalowo jumped into the scene and saved the woman, but not before several minutes of back-and-forth accent battle with Okocha, who ran away from a physical fight with the muscular actor.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZqbWVmhnKBjKaYpJldpsKmsc1mraKclaTAbrzHqKuoq12XvK2tzaWcZqaZo66tu9aoZLChlpp6rbvVnmSsrKKku6h7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ken-norton-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Ken Norton Net Worth 2024</span></a>
