You know? I think sometimes when you read something, when it comes to life it doesn't seem to be what you thought it was," he told the magazine. "But it was not some terrible ending to our relationship. She came back the next day to say goodbye. She helped promote the film. No hard feelings and I couldn't be happier with how the film turned out in the end."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a Notes app screenshot posted to Twitter on Monday night, Rogen said he wanted to "correct a story" that emerged from the interview, saying it "misrepresents what actually happened."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Emma Watson did not 'storm off the set' and it's sh—y that the perception is that she did," he wrote.

We agreed on her not being in the scene together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was thrilled for the opportunity to work with her and would be thrilled to get that opportunity again," he added.
