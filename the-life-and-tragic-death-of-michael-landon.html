"He just had this wonderful humor about everything," he said. "He just made everybody laugh all the time." When filming concluded, Landon gave a speech to the cast and crew about how hard it had been to carry on, with his voice breaking during his speech. "Bonanza" lasted just one more season without Blocker.</p><p>History sadly repeated in 1989. Just a few months after production ended on "Highway to Heaven," Landon's friend and co-star Victor French died. According to the AP, the cause of death was lung cancer, with which French had been diagnosed only three months earlier. But according to Landon, French's alcohol addiction getting the best of him was the real killer, as his "Little House on the Prairie" co-star Karen Grassle wrote in <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>her memoir</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlHFwam9fqbWmecuinZ5lkaOxbsDRmp6im12ZsqLAx2amn2WdnrCprcSlZKWZnpm8r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ralph-lauren-shakes-up-new-york-fashion-week-with-unique-show-at-flagship-store.html><span>←</span><span>Ralph Lauren shakes up New York Fashion Week with unique show at flagship store</span></a>
