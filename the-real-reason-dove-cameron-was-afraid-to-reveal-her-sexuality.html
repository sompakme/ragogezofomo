"It had moving line drawings of people falling in love," she described the visual imagery, adding, "It was all a man and a woman making out and it was a weird moment for me."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>After telling producers to add a kissing gay and a lesbian couple, Cameron revealed she then faced allegations of "queerbaiting."&nbsp;As she told Gay Times, "Everybody got the idea that the song was a big LGBTQ+ anthem song," the "Descendants" star said.&nbsp;"I went on [August 2020's] Instagram Live and said 'Guys, I really needed to explain something to you. Maybe I haven't said it, but I'm super queer. This is something I want to represent through my music because it's who I am.'"</p><p dir=ltr>Cameron avoids labeling her sexuality. "[Coming out] was about who I am as a whole rather than who I choose to date or sleep with," she stated, adding&nbsp;she did not want to "edit myself depending on the room that I'm in." Wisely said!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpjbYZ5e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2ZvLexjJyYpp2ipLtuw8CsZJqeopa2pXnTqGSrnaaarq15x56pZquVrcKiuMitsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-50-best-hairstyles-for-fine-thin-hair.html><span>←</span><span>The 50 Best Hairstyles for Fine, Thin Hair</span></a>
