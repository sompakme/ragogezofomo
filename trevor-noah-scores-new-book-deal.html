His previous book, Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, became a No. 1 <a href=# id=auto-tag_international_1 data-tag=international>international</a> bestseller when it was published in 2016. In fact, it spent 32 weeks on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction list and won the 2017 Thurber Prize for Humor.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the years since, Born a Crime has continued to be required reading in many schools, and, though the process has been anything but quick, the collection of personal stories will be adapted for film, with Lupita Nyong’o attached to play Noah’s mother, Patricia. One World’s executive vp and publisher Chris Jackson, who edited Born a Crime while he was at Spiegel & Grau, acquired the North American, translation and audio rights to the latest book from Noah’s book agent, Peter McGuigan, at Ultra Literary. It is not the Born a Crime follow-up that he inked a deal to write back in 2018.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The news comes as Noah continues to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">settle into his next act</a>. While his decision to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">depart the Comedy Central show</a> after seven years caught almost everyone by surprise, he made clear that he was ready to move on. “I realized that there’s another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring,” he said on-air last fall. “I miss learning other languages, I miss going to other countries and putting on shows, I miss being everywhere and doing everything.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After taking a few weeks to travel and attend the World Cup in Qatar, Noah was back to work,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> touring with his Off the Record Tour </a>and<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> hosting the Grammys</a> for a third time. As he<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> told outgoing late-night host James Corden</a> last month, life after The Daily Show has been “amazing,” noting, “Now I read the news when I want to read the news.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">One World is an imprint of Random House Group, which itself is a division of <a href=# id=auto-tag_penguin-random-house_1 data-tag=penguin-random-house>Penguin Random House</a>. In addition to Ultra Literary, Noah is repped by CAA, Mainstay, Hansen Jacobson and JFPR.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLW%2BxK%2Bmq2WepK6pedaroK2hnpx6r7HWZpmop5tirqO71K1kn6einLa3sc2eqqxlYWeAdn%2BScWpuaF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terry-sanderson-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Terry Sanderson Net Worth 2024</span></a>
