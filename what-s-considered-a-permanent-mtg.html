Once a permanent enters the battlefield, it remains there until it is destroyed, exiled, sacrificed, or otherwise removed according to the game rules. Permanents can be artifacts, creatures, enchantments, lands, or planeswalker cards.</p><h3>What qualifies as a permanent MTG?</h3><p>A permanent is a card or token that is on the battlefield. Permanents can be artifacts, creatures, enchantments, lands, or planeswalker cards. Once a permanent is on the battlefield, it stays there until it’s destroyed, exiled, sacrificed, or otherwise removed according to the game rules.</p><h3>Does a sorcery count as a permanent?</h3><p>No, a sorcery is not considered a permanent in MTG. Sorceries are a type of spell that can only be cast during a player’s main phase when the stack is empty.</p><h3>What’s a noncreature permanent?</h3><p>A noncreature permanent is any permanent card that is not a creature. Examples of noncreature permanents include artifacts, enchantments, lands, and planeswalker cards.</p><h3>Do cards in graveyards count as permanents?</h3><p>No, cards in graveyards do not count as permanents. Permanents exist only on the battlefield. Once a card or token moves from the battlefield to another zone, such as the graveyard, library, or exile, it is no longer a permanent.</p><h3>How do you tell if a card is a permanent MTG?</h3><p>A card is considered a permanent MTG once it enters the battlefield. Permanents stay on the battlefield until they are destroyed, exiled, sacrificed, or otherwise removed. Spells that are not permanents include instants and sorceries, which are typically cast from a player’s hand and have immediate effects.</p><h3>Is an artifact a permanent?</h3><p>Yes, artifacts are considered permanents in MTG. Artifacts can be cast and put onto the battlefield like other permanent cards. They can interact with other cards and permanents and remain on the battlefield until they are destroyed, exiled, sacrificed, or otherwise removed.</p><h3>What is not a permanent in magic?</h3><p>In Magic: The Gathering, not all cards are considered permanents. Instant and sorcery cards, for example, are not permanents. Only cards that can be put onto the battlefield, such as artifacts, creatures, enchantments, lands, and planeswalker cards, are considered permanents.</p><h3>Is a battle a permanent MTG?</h3><p>Yes, a battle is considered a permanent MTG when it is on the battlefield. While on the battlefield, a battle can be affected by abilities or spells that target permanents.</p><h3>Is a planeswalker considered a permanent?</h3><p>Yes, planeswalkers are considered permanents in MTG. They can be cast and put onto the battlefield like other permanent cards. Once on the battlefield, planeswalkers can be used to activate their abilities and interact with other cards and permanents.</p><h3>Does Deathtouch cancel Deathtouch?</h3><p>No, any two instances of the Deathtouch ability against one another do not cancel out the Deathtouch ability. Each instance of Deathtouch still applies, meaning that any creature that is dealt damage by a creature with Deathtouch is destroyed, regardless of the damage dealt.</p><h3>Is a land a colored permanent?</h3><p>No, lands are not colored permanents by default. Lands usually do not have mana costs or colored mana symbols in their cards, so they do not have an inherent color. However, lands with specific abilities or characteristics, such as those that generate colored mana or have specific mana costs, can have a color.</p><h3>Is a aura a permanent?</h3><p>Yes, auras are considered permanents in MTG. Auras are enchantments that can be cast and put onto the battlefield like other permanent cards. Once attached to a permanent on the battlefield, auras are treated as enchantments and can interact with other cards and permanents.</p><h3>Is a commander a permanent MTG?</h3><p>Yes, a commander is considered a permanent in MTG. The commander card is a special card that starts the game in a player’s command zone and can be cast and put onto the battlefield like other permanent cards. Once on the battlefield, the commander can be used to activate its abilities and interact with other cards and permanents.</p><h3>Is a copy a permanent MTG?</h3><p>No, a copy of a card is not considered a permanent in MTG. Copies of cards are typically created as tokens or as a result of spell or ability effects. While the copy is on the battlefield, it may have characteristics of the original card, but it is not considered a permanent itself.</p><h3>Can you tap any permanent MTG?</h3><p>No, you can only tap untapped permanents in MTG. Tapping represents the act of using a permanent’s abilities or resources, and only untapped permanents have the ability to be tapped. Once a permanent is tapped, it remains tapped until it is untapped during the untap step of its controller’s turn.</p><h3>Is dungeon a permanent mtg?</h3><p>No, dungeon cards are not considered permanents in MTG. Dungeon cards exist in a player’s command zone and are not cast as spells or put onto the battlefield. They have their own unique rules and interactions within the game.</p><h3>Is the monarchy a permanent mtg?</h3><p>No, the monarchy is not a permanent in MTG. The monarchy is a game mechanic that represents a special state in the game. While a player is the monarch, they benefit from certain privileges and abilities, but it is not a permanent card on the battlefield and can change hands during the game.</p><h3>Is a suspended card a permanent MTG?</h3><p>No, suspended cards are not considered permanents in MTG. Suspended cards exist in the exile zone with time counters on them. They have a special suspension ability that allows them to return to the battlefield after a specific number of time counters is removed. Once on the battlefield, they are permanents.</p><h3>Is a forest a green permanent?</h3><p>No, a forest is not inherently a green permanent in MTG. Forests are a type of land card that can produce green mana, but by themselves, they do not have an inherent color.
