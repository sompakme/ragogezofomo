Every time an A-list couple gets divorced, their reps swear the split will be civil (after they finally admit that it’s actually happening, of course), and every time things eventually get ugly.
In fact, the more famous the couple, the messier their breakup will inevitably become.
And couples don’t get much more famous than Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She doesn’t believe that her marriage can be repaired.”</p><p>The source says that Bundchen “is doing okay” and has come to terms with the fact that the relationship is over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/tom-brady-and-gisele-bundchen-at-2017-met-gala-682x1024.jpg><p>“She is just trying to figure out her life,” the source says.</p><p>“She doesn’t have much contact with Tom.”</p><p>As for living arrangements, the insider confirms that Gisele has been spending most of her time at a home that she and Tom recently purchased together in Miami.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-1024x723.jpg><p>“Gisele loves Miami. She has friends there. She can see herself living there permanently,”</p><p>“Again, she is still trying to figure things out. She is doing yoga, meditating and taking care of herself. She doesn’t put any pressure on herself to make drastic decisions.”</p><p>It’s probably been tough for Tom to keep his mind on football this season.</p><p>And making matters even more difficult is the fact that former NFL wide receiver and current crazy person Antonio Brown is taunting the QB with memes about himself and Gisele.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>First, Brown (whose career was repeatedly rescued by Brady) posted the above photo in which he and Gisele are seen celebrating the Buccaneers Super Bowl victory.</p><p>He followed that up with a meme about a children’s divorce book.</p><p>As you can see, the cover of “Daddy Doesn’t Live Here Anymore: A Book About Divorce” was altered to suggest that Brown has moved into the Brady home in Tom’s absence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Imagine the guy that gave you your only shot left in the nfl, wanted to see you succeed just to disrespect him in the end of your relevance,” one person commented on the post, according to Page Six.</p><p>“Why? Dude took you in & you clown him, foul!!!” another added.</p><p>“Crazy how your [sic] disrespecting the man who gave you an opportunity to play football when no one else did and was the reason you won a Super Bowl,” a third chimed in.</p><p>Hopefully, these commenters can rest easy in the knowledge that Tom has much bigger problems than some trolling from a former teammate.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z9cLPIrJylnV2Xwq%2BwwqGcp2Wjlsa0edKhnKxllKS7pnnWoquhZaSkum6u0ZqbsmWRo8GwusioZJuqn6y7bsDArqWtq12cvKLAjKqZZqeeYravv9OanquZnWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deadline-fixed-as-igboho-akintoye-write-tinubu-demand-yoruba-nation-s-exit-from-nigeria.html><span>←</span><span>Deadline Fixed as Igboho, Akintoye Write Tinubu, Demand Yoruba Nation's Exit from Nigeria</span></a>
