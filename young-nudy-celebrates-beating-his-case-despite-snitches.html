According to the hitmaker, he's come out on top in a case he's been dealing with for years now, and has his defense team to thank. He also took the opportunity to call out snitches, noting how he even they weren't able to slow him down.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"They can't muthaf**kin stop stop Big Gun," Young Nudy announced to his followers earlier this week. "I been dealing with this s**t for five years with this case. I done beat them folks to sleep. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">My lawyer the best.</a> F**k these snitching-a** n***as. You snitching-a** n***as couldn't stop me, jack," he also added.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-young-nudy-s-legal-win>Young Nudy's Legal Win</h2></span><p>Young Nudy performs live on stage at Revolution Live on April 18, 2023 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

He and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>21 Savage</a> were taken into custody after a traffic stop in February of that year. Nudy was arrested on charges of aggravated assault and being associated with a criminal street gang, while 21 Savage was arrested for being an illegal immigrant. This marked the start of 21 Savage's longwinded legal battle that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">finally came to a close</a> earlier this month.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fans are just glad that Young Nudy has one less obstacle in the way of his career, which only continues to grow. He recently teamed up with Latto and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a> for a remix of "Peaches & Eggplants," was joined onstage by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Offset</a> at his show, and more. He also appears on the deluxe edition of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Killer Mike</a>'s new album MICHAEL, which <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">wasn't easy</a>. Apparently, Killer Mike had to phone in Nudy's mom to get him on the LP. What do you think of Young Nudy finally beating his case? How do you feel about his reaction?
