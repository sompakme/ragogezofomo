No monuments are dedicated to me, and my name will soon be forgotten. But in one respect, I have succeeded as gloriously as anyone who's ever lived; I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and this has always been enough. – <i>Nicholas Sparks</i></li><li>Did my heart love till now?

She is like a trap set by nature - a sweet perfumed rose in whose petals Cupid lurks in ambush! – <i>Edmond Rostand</i></li><li>I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't do anything but think about you. At night I dream of you; all day, I wait to see you, and when I do see you, my heart turns over, and I think I will faint with desire. – <i>Phillipa Gregory</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f43584ca2c465c95.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Funny dating quotes to bring some humour to your relationship</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b3051343882f3fb6.png><ul><li>Anyone who has seen her smile has known perfection. She instils grace in every common thing and divinity in every careless gesture. Venus in her shell was never so lovely, and Diana in the forest never so graceful as my Lady. – <i>Edmond Rostand</i></li><li>If I had, but an hour of love, if that be all that is given me, an hour of love upon this Earth, I would give my love to thee. – <i>Alice Sebold, The Lovely Bones</i></li><li>The day my life changed forever...the day I first saw you. – <i>The Longest Ride</i></li><li>If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you. – <i>A. A. Milne, Winnie the Pooh</i></li><li>I love you, not only for what you are but for what I am when I am with you. – <i>Roy Croft</i></li><li>When I first saw you were more than human to me. You were a Fairy, a Sylph; I didn't know what you were - anything that no one ever saw and everything that everybody ever wanted. I was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an instant. There was no pausing on the brink, no looking down or looking back; I was gone, headlong before I had the sense to say a word to you. –<i> Charles Dickens</i></li><li>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height. My soul can reach. – <i>Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></li><li>I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal. – <i>E.M. Forster, A Room with a View</i></li><li>When I saw you, I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew. – <i>Arrigo Boito</i></li><li>I’m not going to deny that I was aware of your beauty. But the point is, this has nothing to do with your beauty. As I got to know you, I began to realize that beauty was the least of your qualities. I became fascinated by your goodness. I was drawn in by it. – <i>Choderlos de Laclos</i></li><li>If you remember me, then I don’t care if everyone else forgets. – <i>Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore</i></li><li>People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that’s what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your attention so you can change your life –<i> Elizabeth Gilbert</i></li><li>I didn’t understand what was happening to me. And it was only when I began to feel actual, physical pain every time you left the room that it finally dawned on me: I was in love for the first time in my life. I knew it was hopeless, but that didn’t matter to me. And it’s not that I want to have you. All I want is to deserve you. – <i>Choderlos de Laclos</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/39810c81fa79c47d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Funny quotes to lighten the mood for when the going gets tough</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5aeb39b57175c9ce.jpg><h3>Do good morning texts matter?</h3><p class=align-left>She will value your good morning texts if she loves getting your attention.</p><h2>What is the point of good morning texts?</h2><p class=align-left>A good morning text confirms you are awake and thinking about them.
