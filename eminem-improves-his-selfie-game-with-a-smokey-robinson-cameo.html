Taking baby steps into a medium he was not born into, Em's attempts at&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Instagram stories</a> and selfies have been truly interesting, to say the least. One of the leaders of Detroit's music scene, Marshall has led the stampede in the Motor City for the last two decades. Before him, a systematic approach to making hits was crafted by Motown in the same city, influencing sounds for years to come. Em had a chance to meet up with one of the most prominent Motown musicians, Smokey Robinson, and he made sure to&nbsp;digitalize the moment.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Although his selfie skills can still be improved, Shady posed for a picture with the former frontman of The Miracles, Smokey Robinson, marking him as one of the GOATs in his caption. Recognizing that he was in the presence of greatness, Em wrote, "Motown in the building. #selfie," alongside an emoji of a goat. Whether or not the two have any plans for a collaboration is unclear but that would make for one hell of a Detroit duo.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With his Sunday performance at Coachella's second weekend creeping up, maybe an official celebration of Motown could happen in Coachella&nbsp;Valley. In what would be an absolutely awe-inspiring moment, we're crossing our fingers that everybody in attendance will be in for a treat come Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZ391gphmnKahnpq6brXMqamorpWoeqm10maqnqSWnrJus8CmnGavmam1bq2MrKSoo5WuerO7waKlrKeeYrCiucSoZKedp6g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dmx-hospitalized-after-reported-overdose.html><span>←</span><span>DMX Hospitalized After Reported Overdose</span></a>
