The curvaceous artist's year is already off to a great start, as she celebrates her 23rd birthday today (January 1).</p><p>To commemorate the exciting moment, she posted some salacious snapshots that chiefly find her flaunting her behind for the camera. "Cake day and I got a lot," her caption reads.</p><p>The first photo finds Spice's cheeks breaking out beneath a black outfit in the mirror. Next, she steps outside to tan her figure in a tiny bikini paired with bright fuzzy slippers. Other additions include tropical beach shots, a video originally uploaded on TikTok, and a beautiful display of rose petals laid out on her bed.</p><p>Additionally, the "Bikini Bottom" hitmaker recreated the carousel's first photo, though this time around she bared far more skin – and booty.</p><p>Plenty of friends have dropped by the comment section already to send Spice birthday greetings. "Damn shawty [heart eyes emoji]," <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chloe Bailey</a> wrote alongside hers. Rubi Rose, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Nas X</a>, and Lakeyah also left kind words for the Bronx baddie.</p><p>Rapper Ice Spice attends BET Hip Hop Awards 2022 on September 30, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.
