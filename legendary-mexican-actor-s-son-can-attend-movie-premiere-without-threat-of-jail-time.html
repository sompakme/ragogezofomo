The late actor’s son told the court that he had since settled with Columbia and was doing everything he could to obey the judge’s old order. He wanted to attend the August 27 Los Angeles premiere of the bio-pic of his father.</p><p>Columbia didn’t oppose.</p><p>“Because it appears that Ivanova has complied with the Contempt Orders, and the Parties have stipulated to the same, the Court finds that there is no longer any need to encourage compliance,” writes the judge in a ruling on Thursday. “As such, the contempt sanctions, including the monetary sanctions, should be terminated.”</p><p>Here is a trailer of the new film:</p><p></p><p>Email: Eriq.Gardner@THR.com<br>Twitter: @<a href=# rel=nofollow>eriqgardner</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmpZ2XmrulrdGyZKadqJ6worqMmpqtp6KoerS7zWaamqZdbH93fY9uZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jada-pinkett-smith-and-will-s-family-divided-as-she-reveals-kids-willow-jaden-and-trey-s-habits.html><span>←</span><span>Jada Pinkett Smith and Will's family divided as she reveals kids Willow, Jaden and Trey's habits</span></a>
