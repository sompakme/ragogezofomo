Rahm Emanuel was born November 29, 1959 in Chicago, Illinois. He worked on the Chicago congressional campaign for David Robinson, where he earned a reputation for tenacious fundraising, and went on to hold several more political positions, including U.S. Representative and White House Chief of Staff (for President <a href=#>Barack Obama</a>). In 2011, Emanuel was elected mayor of Chicago, succeeding Richard Daley. After graduating from Sarah Lawrence College (Bronxville, New York) with a bachelor's degree in 1981, Emanuel attended Northwestern University in Chicago. During his studies there, he also worked in local and national politics, including a stint working on Democrat Paul Simon's 1984 election campaign for U.S. Senate. His first post-graduation job, after earning a master's degree in speech and communication from Northwestern, was with the consumer rights organization Illinois Public Action. In 1988, Emanuel served as the national campaign director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and in 1989 he became the senior advisor and chief fundraiser for Richard Daley's campaign for the Chicago mayorship. Emanuel reportedly served briefly as a civilian volunteer in the Israel Defense Forces in 1991, during the first Gulf War. Emanuel's fundraising abilities helped win him a job as Director of Finance for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992. In January 2007, the new Democratic majority elected Emanuel to serve as chair of the Democratic Caucus‚Äîthe fourth-highest ranking member of House Democratic leadership. On September 30, 2010, Emanuel left his post as chief of staff to President Obama to run for Mayor of Chicago. He was replaced in the interim by political consultant Peter Rouse. On February 22, 2011, Emanuel was elected mayor of Chicago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeilrWuecSmmKetlaF6r7HTZq6oqqSdenN8mHJvbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pooch-hall-net-worth-2024.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Pooch Hall Net Worth 2024</span></a>
