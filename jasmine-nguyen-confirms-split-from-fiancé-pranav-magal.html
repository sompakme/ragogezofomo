The reality star, who had found love outside the show, confirmed in an emotional Instagram video that her engagement with Pranav Magal has come to an end.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>&nbsp;Love Found and Lost</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While Jasmine may not have found love on The Bachelor, she found it in the real world. She and Pranav, a doctor specializing in Anesthesiology, began their journey together in 2019. Despite her initial appearance on the show, Jasmine’s heart led her to Pranav, and their love story blossomed.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>A Proposal to Remember</strong></h3><p>In December, Pranav asked Jasmine to be his wife, and the world got a glimpse of their happiness through Jasmine’s social media posts. She joyfully shared the news with Bachelor Nation, saying, “MY FREAKIN FIANCÉ !!!! We are on cloud nine. Dec 3, 2019 – Our very first date. Dec 3, 2021 – You asked me to be your wife.”</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;Signs of Trouble</strong></h3><p>Eagle-eyed fans started to notice a change when Jasmine removed all photos of Pranav from her social media. Speculations grew about the state of their relationship as weeks went by without any official word.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Heartfelt Confirmation</strong></h3><p>Finally, on February 21, Jasmine broke her silence in a heartfelt video message to her followers. She tearfully confirmed the end of her engagement, saying, “I know that you guys have noticed that I have not been on here lately and I have seen your sweet DMs and comments and I just wanted to say first and foremost, thank you. I love you guys.”</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;Facing the Reality</strong></h3><p>Jasmine continued, “There is no easy way for me to say this, but the engagement has ended, and we are no longer together. I was looking forward to this next chapter so badly. I was so excited to be a wife and start a family, and I was so sure that I found my person.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Coping with the Loss</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Amid tears, Jasmine shared her pain, “I know that I am going to get questions on if I am okay. I’m not, guys. I’m not, but I have taken this time to be with myself and be with my people, and I know with time, I will be.”</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;Support from Fans</strong></h3><p>Despite the heartbreak, Jasmine received an outpouring of support from her fans and followers. Messages of encouragement flooded her comment section as people rallied behind her during this difficult time.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>&nbsp;Pranav Magal’s Privacy</strong></h3><p>Unlike Jasmine, Pranav has maintained a more private online presence. While the couple had shared some moments together on social media, Pranav generally prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye.</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;A New Chapter</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Jasmine’s journey may have taken an unexpected turn, but her honesty and vulnerability in sharing her experience have endeared her to many. As she navigates this new chapter in her life, her fans will undoubtedly continue to offer their support and love.</p><p>In the world of reality TV and love, Jasmine Nguyen’s story reminds us that sometimes even the most promising relationships can come to an end.
