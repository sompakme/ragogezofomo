"Sunrise was, like, nine and a half months pregnant, and the baby was imminently coming."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3S2MEe6FCkAHxTbup3tZZg-1920-80.jpg><p>Recalling the unusual way he found out about the tumor, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29063166/mark-ruffalo-boris-johnson-twitter/>Ruffalo</a> continued, "I had one of those 4 a.m. calls, and I woke up probably around 3, and I just had this crazy dream. It wasn’t like any other dream I ever had. It was just like, 'You have a brain tumor.' It wasn’t even a voice. It was just pure knowledge, 'You have a brain tumor, and you have to deal with it immediately.'"</p><p>He explained that he only had one symptom, and said, "It's funny, I had an ear infection that night, and that was hurting me, so I went to the cast doctor the next day ... and I said, 'Listen, this is going to sound crazy, but I had this dream last night I had a brain tumor.'"</p><p>The doctor told him that it did sound a bit "crazy," but that they would do a CAT scan so that he wouldn't have to worry unnecessarily. But of course, the scan ended up detecting that something wasn't right.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

We don’t know what it is, we can’t tell until it’s biopsied.'"</p><p>The growth turned out to be a benign tumor, and Ruffalo kept the diagnosis to himself for weeks until right before the surgery to remove it.</p><p>"When I told Sunny about it, first she thought I was joking," he explained. "And then she just burst into tears and said, 'I always knew you were gonna die young.'"</p><p>Doctors warned Ruffalo that the surgery carried risks, including a 70 percent chance that he would lose his hearing in that ear, which he did. Still, he counted that as a blessing, saying that he prayed to a God he didn't really believe in, "Take my hearing, but let me keep the face, and just let me be the father of these kids."</p><p>Happily, Ruffalo and Coigney ended up also welcoming daughter Bella, 18, and Odette, 16, and the actor was able to keep building up his successful career as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGilkae4br7Un52apJ9ir7OtyKdkra2dpL9uw8ifnGarpaO%2Fqr%2FEZpqooZejsrp7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mariya-putina-bio-affair-father-relationship-status-career-history.html><span>←</span><span>Mariya Putina Bio, Affair, Father, Relationship Status, Career, History</span></a>
