A huge reason for this is because of the rapper's mother Liza Womack. She had a sweet message for the undying supporters when she helped rollout the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">original version of Come Over When You're Sober , Pt. 2</a>. "I encourage Gus’s fans to enjoy the music that Gus created, listened to, and loved." It was clear that they had a beautiful and loving mother/son relationship and it makes it all the more saddening that he is still not with us today.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To help <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">carry on the spirit of Lil Peep</a>, his team has just put out a short project called HATE ME. It is an EP with three tracks, all recorded back in October of 2016. For context, that is when Peep released his first two projects, crybaby and HELLBOY. According to Genius, these recordings were pushed by First Access Entertainment, a UK-founded company that has its subsidiary label called Access Records.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-hate-me-by-lil-peep>Listen To HATE ME By Lil Peep</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Apparently, they wanted Lil Peep to go more radio-friendly and mainstream with these tracks. But, they encouraged him to keep the same lyrical content we are used to hearing from the emo rap legend. It features two "og versions" for "Spotlight" and "Hate Me." The first of the two was a track with EDM superstar Marshmello, while the latter was on Come Over When You're Sober , Pt. 2.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new EP, HATE ME, by Lil Peep? Is this some of his strongest posthumous material yet, why or why not? What is your favorite song and why? Was he the best emo rapper in the game, or does he still hold that title? We would like to hear what you have to say, so be sure to leave your takes in the comments section. Additionally, always keep it locked in with&nbsp;HNHH&nbsp;for all of the latest news surrounding Lil Peep. Finally, stay with us for the most informative project posts throughout the week.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>HATE ME Tracklist:</strong></p><li>Spotlight - og version</li><li>Looking For You</li><li>Hate Me - og version</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbH93gpVmo6KkXaWypryMoZitnV2ism60yKlkoaegYrumw9I%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-allen-white-is-dapper-in-a-white-tux-at-the-delayed-2023-emmys.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Allen White Is Dapper in a White Tux at the Delayed 2023 Emmys</span></a>
