Police arrived to disperse the blockage, but cars were still stuck at the time of publication. The protests ultimately led to the delay of the broadcast, which was meant to start at 4 p.m. PT; it ultimately began with a cold open at 4:06 p.m. PT.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Protesters have shut down the flow of traffic to the <a href=# rel=nofollow>#Oscars</a> red carpet, causing many attendees to get out of their cars and walk to the Dolby Theatre</p><p>üé•: Scott Feinberg <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/QBgWoFUbBG</a></p>‚Äî The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 10, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As the event‚Äôs expected guests passed, the direct action protest, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/free-palestine-march-oscars-los-angeles-1235847420/>calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire</a> in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, grew acrimonious, with some demonsrators yelling directly at people seemingly headed to the Oscars. Activists wearing Keffiyehs and waving Palestinian flags shouted ‚Äúshame‚Äù at people dressed in tuxedos and evening gowns. As they chanted ‚ÄúCeasefire now!,‚Äù one protester flung red paint onto a man‚Äôs suit while he attempted to get to the ceremony and frazzled executives told&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;of scenes of protestors hurling things at their vehicles.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Academy gave some attendees rides to the event in golf carts. The Academy <a href=# id=auto-tag_awards_1 data-tag=awards>Awards</a>‚Äô private security, wearing identical tuxedos with ‚ÄúA‚Äù pins in their lapels, came down Highland Avenue and, at one point, seemingly to help escort arrivals through the protest. But the police turned them back.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The protest consisted of pro-Palestinian groups including Writers Against the War on Gaza L.A., Film Workers For Palestine and SAG-AFTRA Members for Ceasefire, according to a press release. Organizers and participants hoped the spectacle and disruption of the action would draw attention to the pending ground invasion of Rafah.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Many top Hollywood executives were delayed at least an hour because of the protest. Disney chief Bob Iger and his wife, Willow, were among those who were rushed into the awards at the last minute, as were Amazon executive Jennifer Salke and Paramount‚Äôs Brian Robbins, among others. One studio executive stuck in his car said he didn‚Äôt understand why it took so long for the cops to move the protestors.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">‚ÄúThey knew it was happening,‚Äù he noted of the highly-anticipated ceremony. ‚ÄúAnd they allowed this to happen?‚Äù</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">SAG-AFTRA Members for Ceasefire organizer and actor Amin El Gamal told&nbsp;THR&nbsp;that plans for the protest had been in the works for months, growing partly from a dissatisfaction with the response of industry labor groups to the invasion.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As the chaos caused major delays, Academy staffers began radioing among themselves that the red carpet was being kept open later than expected. On the carpet, many publicists expressed confusion, unaware of the protests and describing the red carpet as ‚Äúempty.‚Äù Most of the chaos was invisible to those watching the broadcast, which ran smoothly through the opening monologue and into the announcement of the winner of the first award handed out, best supporting actress.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Los Angeles Police Department announced a citywide tactical alert Sunday in response to the protests, authorities confirmed. ‚ÄúA Dispersal Order was issued in the area of Sunset Boulevard and Cherokee Avenue for Unlawful Assembly. Stay away from the area,‚Äù the LAPD&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>wrote on X</a>, later tweeting to expect traffic delays.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">‚ÄîBorys Kit and Pamela McClintock contributed reporting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLG%2BzmanmqSVqMGqusRmp6unpJrAtb%2BMnaCsqqWlwW7A0Zqdn6GTYry0r8CrqmZpYmiCeYCXamtsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicki-minaj-s-sister-tells-the-barbz-to-keep-her-out-of-megan-thee-stallion-beef.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Nicki Minaj's Sister Tells The Barbz To Keep Her Out Of Megan Thee Stallion Beef</span></a>
