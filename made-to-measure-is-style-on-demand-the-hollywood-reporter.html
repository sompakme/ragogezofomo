<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Made to Measure Is Style On Demand The Hollywood Reporter</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>With the rise of designer Made-to-Measure, there’s a newly important option between the endless variations of old school bespoke tailoring and just buying a suit off the rack. <span data-scayt_word=MTM data-scaytid=1>MTM</span> offers the client a selection of signature styles, or models, to be made up in fabric of the customer’s choice and with modifications to suit his physique and personal tastes. And, increasingly, <span data-scayt_word=MTM data-scaytid=2>MTM</span> is going beyond the boardroom with luxury sportswear, shoes and accessories part of the mix.</p><p><strong>See more&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>‘<span data-scayt_word=Spectre data-scaytid=6>Spectre</span>‘ Press Tour: See The Bond Ladies’ Best Looks</a></p><p>“Especially in our world in Hollywood, everyone wants things right away,” says executive style consultant Andrew <span data-scayt_word=Weitz data-scaytid=7>Weitz</span>, explaining that the <span data-scayt_word=MTM data-scaytid=3>MTM</span> is also easier for the client to visualize since it’s based on existing suit models. “If you know you look good in a designer’s cut of suiting and you want it in another fabric or maybe the button stance of the jacket is a little high or low low, you can adjust that.”</p><p>And Saks Fifth Avenue vice-president and men’s fashion director Eric Jennings says <span data-scayt_word=MTM data-scaytid=5>MTM</span> is another way for Hollywood’s men to signal their personal style in the era of increased online coverage and <span data-scayt_word=Instagram data-scaytid=10>Instagram</span>. “It’s critical for executives to stand out now and customizing their style is becoming&nbsp; essential to their own brand building.”</p><p>One sign of its new importance was the splashy fall ad campaign from <span data-scayt_word=menswear data-scaytid=12>menswear</span> maestro Giorgio Armani featuring actors Dan Stevens and Matt <span data-scayt_word=Bomer data-scaytid=13>Bomer</span> and Chinese star Chen Kun, a first to present this custom service in a fashion light. “I think designers want to break in even more with L.A. and that’s why you see them redesigning their stores the last few years and putting more money into the Hollywood world,” says <span data-scayt_word=Weitz data-scaytid=11>Weitz</span>. The compressed delivery time averaging two months from first consultation to final delivery is the big draw, even with a price tag that starts at 10 to 20 per cent more than off-the-peg and climbs precipitously for luxury fabrics like cashmere and superfine <span data-scayt_word=wools data-scaytid=15>wools</span>.</p><p><strong>Read more</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Emilia Clarke Is The New Face of Dior Jewelry</a></p><p>“All of our luxury tailored clothing brands offer Made-to-Measure,” says Jennings and Saks also has its own <span data-scayt_word=SFA-branded data-scaytid=19>SFA-branded</span> program with options in classic all-American, elegant Italian and modern London-derived silhouettes. And <span data-scayt_word=Barneys data-scaytid=20>Barneys</span> New York offers exclusive <span data-scayt_word=MTM data-scaytid=16>MTM</span> options from vaunted Paris tailors <span data-scayt_word=Cifonelli data-scaytid=22>Cifonelli</span> and Rome’s renowned <span data-scayt_word=Battistoni data-scaytid=23>Battistoni</span>, among others.</p><p>“I think its great for the guy who doesn’t want to shop or have the time. He can pick up the phone and call his guy and they have his measurements,” says <span data-scayt_word=Weitz data-scaytid=18>Weitz</span>. “He can say, ‘I want to order four more shirts, four more suits,’ or whatever and ‘boom!’ it shows up at his door.”</p><p>***</p><p><strong>1.
