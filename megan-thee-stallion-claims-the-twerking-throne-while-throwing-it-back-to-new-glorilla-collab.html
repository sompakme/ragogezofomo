"IG after dark lol and nobody better not challenge me bc this the best a** on IG," she captioned her video. "or if you think so tag me in your video [crying-laughing emoji] stream WANNA BE." Not only that, but the Houston MC also tagged some of her friends in the comments, challenging them to one-up her skills. "you win!!!!" <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chloe Bailey</a> wrote under the clip, whereas Big Glo had this to say in two separate comments: "Omggggggggg... I’m posting mine tomorrow you gmfu."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, this is par the course for a lot of Megan Thee Stallion's dancing prowess online, and more importantly, it's tied to a pretty solid banger. She might evoke the lust of many a thirsty social media user, but in 2024, it's been clear that her comeback won't slouch on the artistic tip. With singles like "Cobra" and "HISS" under the 29-year-old's belt already, her lyrical and performance prowess on these cuts was a treat for fans to witness. Also, an <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">upcoming summer tour</a> is bound to yield some big moments, impressive displays of all of the above, and plenty of growth.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-megan-thee-stallion-twerks-up-a-storm-to-wanna-be-watch>Megan Thee Stallion Twerks Up A Storm To "Wanna Be": Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, there have also been recent indications that this side of Megan Thee Stallion, the throw-it-back queen, might not take center stage on her next full-length. "How many songs do y'all feel like y'all wanna hear on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">this album</a>?" she asked fans during a recent Instagram Live session. "In my mind, I was thinking 14, but I keep recording songs that's so good! The first 20 songs I had, I'm just straight rapping. And then I started being in a better mood, so it's like feel-good songs,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;I got in a ratchet mood because you know it's about to be summertime!</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I just remember how y'all used to really whack me for making pop that a** music," Thee Stallion continued. "I really wanted to get on y'all's a**es and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">show y'all how bad I can rap</a>, so I really haven't been in touch with my roots. I'm trying to see if y'all wanna pop that a**, what it's giving?" Apparently, her pen is making a strong return on her next album either way, and that's more exciting than anything.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
