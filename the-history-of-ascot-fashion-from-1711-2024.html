Let's not forget the elegant take on the boho movement during the 1970s, and also the momentous gender-norm defying moment in 2017, when Saville Row tailor Daisy Knatchbull became the first woman known to wear a morning suit.

"It thrust the hips backwards and forced the chest forward into a fashionable pouter-pigeon shape," explains the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>V&A</a>. This silhouette was "emphasised with puffed, frilly blouses that were often embellished with decorations like lace collars and broad ribbon ties.

Lots of Ascot fashion of the 1920s reflected the eras iconic flapper dress. Though women still wore shapewear, full corsets were falling out of fashion, dresses were slightly shorter and more freeing. We have Coco Chanel to thank for a lot of iconic fashion silhouettes, including the popularisation of the flapper. She was of course also a pioneer of pearls, which for Ascot were accompanied by fur accessories for that added touch of luxury.</p><h2 data-gid=e92WRzNOrg>Ascot Fashion: <strong data-gid=eamkeOy4bB>1930s</strong></h2><p id=eTwqF_mDBt- data-wc=50>The drop-waist androgyny of the previous decade gave way to a slinky femininity in the 1930s. "Parisian couturiers introduced the bias-cut into their designs, which caused the fabric to skim over the body's curves," explains the V&A. Long, simple and clinging evening gowns, made of satin were popular at Ascot.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/39dbc1b24c15-gettyimages-102730697.jpg><h2 data-gid=eWLHLxj0ai>Ascot Fashion: <strong data-gid=ewqj3qPfag>1940s</strong></h2><p id=eBc_O7cdKt1 data-wc=72>As a result of the WW2 there were severe fabric shortages, which lasted until the end of the decade. Skirts were a little below the knee and straight, worn with boxy jackets and broad, padded shoulders. From 1942 onwards &nbsp;clothes were made under the government Utility Scheme that rationed materials. During the war, accessories were important because of their relative affordability; tall platform shoes or sandals, and tall floral hats were fashionable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/32ab0076a696-gettyimages-3362727.jpg><h2 data-gid=eTwqF_mDBt->Ascot Fashion: 1950s&nbsp;</h2><p id=el47YZdRRp9G data-wc=28>During the 1950s dresses with pencil or full skirts as well as separates were popular at Ascot.
