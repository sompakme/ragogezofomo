He used the word to describe fellow houseguest, America Lopez.</p><p>Jared confronted Cory Wurtenberger while Izzy Gleicher was there. “I don’t think she’s (America) the R-word. I slipped up. I’m sorry about that,” Jared said to Cory.</p><p>He said he’s “obviously angry” and “willing to admit that.” Jared added, “At the end of the day, I need you to see where I’m coming from. The moment somebody does not choose to benefit my game…”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-big-brother-s-code-of-conduct>What is Big Brother’s code of conduct?</h2><p>Matt Turner from <a href=#>Big Brother</a> 24 posted part of the Code of Conduct by CBS for the feeds. In the Code of Conduct, using negative speech or slurs against people with a disability is forbidden.</p><p>When Luke Valentine used a racial slur, CBS wrote: “Luke violated the Big Brother code of conduct and there is zero tolerance in the house for using a racial slur. He has been removed from the house.”</p><p>Other rules are that they shall have no contact with the outside world while housemates must wear microphone lapels at all times, except when swimming or sleeping.</p><p><strong>GRV Media and Reality Titbit have contacted CBS for comment.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jared had apparently called America the R Word. <a href=#>#bb25</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2vCxBOHu5W</a></p>— 🔥 BBXtra 🔥 (@BigBrotherXtra) <a href=#>September 2, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-want-jared-to-be-removed>Fans want Jared to be removed</h2><p>One viewer said: “@CBSBigBrother where is the energy for the r-word? It’s unacceptable.” Another penned: “He did, why is he still in the house? That’s against BB rules. Jared go home!”</p><p>“He should be removed from the house,” reacted a fellow fan after seeing Jared on Big Brother 25 reference the R-word during a recent episode.</p><p>One fan wrote: “@CBSBigBrother Please inform production that this is an ableist slur, and therefore it is against the established Code of Conduct.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The R word is very demeaning and problematic, and shouldn’t be used period. I doubt they will expel Jared since we didn’t actually see him saying it, although he referenced it. Now will they penalize him?
