While that statistic is occasionally irritating, it also means that I have had the opportunity to test well over 100 different formulas throughout my beauty editor career. Some days, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/best-clear-mascaras/>mascara</a> is smudged and running down my face. Other days, I hit the mascara jackpot and have lashes that are lengthened, lifted, and volumized. The best mascaras genuinely do it all.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you’ll want to find the best formula for you. Certain mascaras are light and natural-looking by design, with wands capable of separating every little lash. Other mascaras are developed to add density, thickness, and deep black pigment. You can opt for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-tubing-mascara/>tubing mascaras</a>, which are currently rising in popularity—Merit makes one of the best. Or, you can buy <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-brown-mascara/>brown mascara</a> and cosign the soft girl makeup trend (Westman Atelier, Tower 28, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/victoria-beckham/>Victoria Beckham</a> recently dropped shade extensions).&nbsp;</p><p>Make note of your lash goals because I’ve rounded up my favorite mascaras—and asked the Marie Claire team, celebrity makeup artists, and industry experts to share their go-tos—ahead.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-mascaras><span>The Best Mascaras</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Ilia Limitless Lash Mascara"><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVSX4eNvZqNeWDAxQBPXF7-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Mascara Overall</span></p></a><p>Ilia Limitless Lash Mascara</p><p>No matter how many mascaras I test, I always return to this tried and true Ilia product. It defines every lash, never looks clumpy, and comes off with incredible ease. Celebrity makeup artist <a href=#>Shadi Malek</a>, who has worked with mega-influencers like Alix Earle and Arianna Madix, shares my sentiment. “The formula is incredible because it makes your lashes thicker and longer, but it’s a hypoallergenic product that won’t irritate your eyes,” she says. As a chronic dry eye sufferer, I can confirm it’s incredibly gentle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Makeup artist-recommended; Gentle; Lengthens&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Doesn’t add a ton of volume&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“Hands down my favorite mascara for every day.&nbsp;I'm probably on my 20th tube.&nbsp;This formula can look natural or dramatic depending on how much you apply and lasts all day without any fallout.” — Sephora&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="YSL Lash Clash Extreme Volume Mascara" readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MXa4Sqtygqa5zAsWgN62UL-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Waterproof Mascara</span></p></a><p>YSL Lash Clash Extreme Volume Mascara</p><p>Everyone needs at least one waterproof mascara in their collection. They’re a savior for watery eyes and the best defense against humidity-induced smudging—just take Beauty Director <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/deena-campbell/>Deena Campbell</a>’s word for it. “This mascara plays no games for those needing an intense formula that won’t smudge, fade, or clump,” she says. “One coat does the trick, but it’s very buildable, so apply two or three for extra drama.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Great for volume; Deep black shade&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Can smudge</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong> “This is a great waterproof mascara, overall. I have to apply several coats but it lengthens and stays all day. The only issue I have with it is when I apply it on my lower lashes, I get a few smudges under my eyes within the first few minutes.” — Sephora&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Tower 28 Makewaves Mascara"><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/weAqTW8TFvWnAFYUYgFb6Q-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Tubing Mascara</span></p></a><p>Tower 28 Makewaves Mascara</p><p>Tower 28 is sensitive skin-friendly, so a tubing mascara tolerant of easily irritated eyes made perfect sense for the brand. When this mascara launched, it unsurprisingly made waves (pun very much intended), going viral on TikTok and gaining celebrity fans like Quinta Brunson. The brush designs and patented Aquaflex technology allow lashes to hold an incredible curl throughout the day, while fighting against the effects of humidity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Tubing mascara; Comes in brown&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Some say it flakes off&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“Not clumpy.

Telescopic black-brown is a game-changer for everyday wear. Makeup artist <a href=#>Kelli Anne Sewell</a>, who has worked with mega-influencers like Alix Earle and Leonie Hanne, names this one of her favorites thanks to the soft, natural finish it creates. It’s incredibly lengthening, too—just shimmy the wand from your lash line to tips on repeat.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Perfect for lower lashes; Makeup artist-recommended&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not great volume&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“I am a big fan of this mascara and have bought it at least five times. I bought the regular (non-waterproof) version, and it holds all day without smudging.

It’s incredibly high-performing, which is precisely why Marie Claire’s E-Commerce Analyst, Sophie Cookson, can’t get enough of it. “It lasts all day without clumping or flaking, and the hourglass shape of the brush catches every last one of my lashes,” she shares. It will provide some lengthening benefits, but volumizing is its strong suit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Long lasting; No smudging&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Has a strong scent&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“This one does it all—flake-free, smudge-free, buildable, and clean formula for sensitive eyes.

Enter Victoria Beckham’s Future Lash Mascara. The wand is semi-circle-shaped, which is perfect for giving my lashes the curve they so desperately need. It’s a lighter finish—on the fluttery side more than the dramatic. That said, if I layer the formula, I can achieve a deeper, fluffier finish.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Lifting and lengthening; Washes off easily; Good for everyday&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not great for volume&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review</strong> “I'm in love with the brush. It's so delicate and easily maneuverable around my eye. I didn't get any makeup on my lid and that NEVER happens. It deposits the mascara slowly, if that makes sense, leaving it possible for me to have a lot or a little, depending on how I feel that day. It also does not smudge or flake which is another miracle.” —Victoria Beckham</p><a href=# data-model-name="Dior diorshow Icon Mascara" readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4wX8nySEtd8rUGjds62nA-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Do-It-All Mascara</span></p></a><p>Dior diorshow Icon Mascara</p><p>I have the wateriest eyes known to man and can’t get on board with waterproof mascara. Finding a formula that stays put throughout the day and doesn’t leave me with a black, smudged shadow by noon has been a struggle. That’s where this Dior mascara has been a game changer. It doesn’t run or smudge and simultaneously lifts, volumizes, and lengthens. I’m not shy about applying multiple coats either—I promise, it won’t flake off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Multi-benefit; Never clumpy</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not great for bottom lashes</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“ I have fairly thick and long lashes naturally and the brush is very easy to maneuver through and separate them.

Despite trying dozens of formulas, she always goes back to Gucci. “The skinny, almond-shaped, flexible brush lets me grab every hair while the formula softens and lengthens my lashes, providing the perfect sweep of jet black color.” Her only ask of the brand? To make the formula in a brown shade.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lengthens; Sleek packaging&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Difficult to remove&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“My lashes have always been very prone to clumping.

Still, Selena Gomez’s signature look was enough to convince her to give Rare a try. “I randomly did a Sephora haul in January and begrudgingly bought the Rare Beauty mascara, not knowing it’d become my new staple product. Now, I repurchase this mascara every time it runs out. This mascara will look the same at the end of the day, even with the most hectic schedule,” she shares.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Volumizing; Stays on all day; No Smudging&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Brush is a little think for lower lashes</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“This mascara gives your lashes a new life who has short lashes like me.

If you want a long, defined lash, the bristles on the wand should be long and defined. A densely packed, chunkier brush is the goal if you're after thick, voluminous lashes.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-is-a-tubing-mascara><span>What Is a Tubing Mascara?</span></h2><p>If you’ve been on BeautyTok recently, you’ve noticed the industry’s increasing fascination with tubing mascaras. Tubing mascaras are nothing new, but with recent launches from Merit and Tower28, they’re having a little resurgence. “Tubing mascara is unique because the formula creates a literal tube around your lash,” explains Sewell. “When you wash your eyes at the end of the night, you’ll see tubes being removed—not smudgy, watery particles.” It creates a mess-free, straightforward removal process that doesn’t irritate sensitive eyes.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-apply-mascara><span>How to Apply Mascara</span></h2><p>Every artist has their tip or hack for getting the best result. Makeup artist Shadi Malek, who works with Arianna Maddix, Tracy Tudor, and Nikki Hilton, starts with the mascara wand at the base of the lashes. “Wiggle the wand back and forth towards the tip of your lashes and then repeat the motion until you like the thickness.” If you’re struggling to hold a curl, makeup artist Billie Gene, whose clients include Winnie Harlow and Kerry Washington, recommends “tapping the lash with the brush to add volume and lift.”&nbsp;</p><p>Occasionally, you may find that one mascara isn’t meeting your lash goals. Should that be the base, don’t shy away from layering. “I typically start with a lengthening mascara to separate the lashes, and then I’ll layer a voluminous formula on top for desired volume,” advises Sewell.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-expert><span>Meet the Expert</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVSX4eNvZqNeWDAxQBPXF7-1920-80.jpg><span class=person__name>Shadi Malek </span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Celebrity Makeup Artist<p>Shadi Malek’s career of nearly a decade in the make-up industry is a testament to her passionate practice, one that has resulted in an extensive list of life-long clients.
