However, the post was short-lived, as it disappeared from the account hours later, presumably removed by Kim, who was attending Paris Fashion Week at the time, without North.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/43f14a2b40b0-059c12b2-e538-4ac4-ab13-f720f78ff936.jpg><p id=eU4PfNldHHR data-wc=40>The internet's reaction was swift and varied, with fans and observers alike flocking to forums like Reddit to comment on the incident. "LMAOOO North is so messy," exclaimed one fan, capturing the blend of amusement and surprise that many felt.&nbsp;</p><p id=emYDVn4Odk- data-wc=28>Another commenter speculated, "It’s the only repost on their account. This is hilarious I don’t think she meant to repost it," suggesting the possibility of an accidental share.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/52c54b13288f-32727328912670361475777634825800277784953126n.jpg><p id=eqvj-qua-Z- data-wc=71>Yet, amidst the laughter, some expressed concern over the potential implications of such actions, especially considering the historical tension between Taylor Swift and North's parents, Kim and Kanye. "Uh oh lol, I understand North probably saw it online but I hope [Kim and Kanye West] are not spewing hate behind the scenes around their kids, that would just be ugly and unnecessary to let your kids know," a concerned fan remarked.&nbsp;</p><p id=ek9NoU_SpSK data-wc=19>The swift removal of the video added another layer to the discussion, with speculation about Kim's oversight while away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/46379fece130-gettyimages-1210047507.jpg><p id=eIZEvY7BLBA data-wc=22>The backdrop to this incident is a longstanding feud between Taylor Swift and the Wests, which traces back to the 2009 VMAs.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebpg4dllWL9 data-wc=47>A moment that has since become infamously etched in pop culture history, Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance speech for Best Female Video, proclaiming, “Taylor, I’m really happy for you and I’mma let you finish … but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”&nbsp;</p><p id=e4eWpcICA9z data-wc=22>This event set off a series of public back-and-forths, with both parties addressing the incident through their music and in the media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a13d77163266-screen-shot-2024-02-28-at-95950-am.png><p id=eLJ_SmburOv data-wc=27>Kanye's track Famous reignited the feud with controversial lyrics about Taylor, which he claimed she had approved—an assertion that Taylor vehemently denied, leading to further public disputes.</p><p id=eGZzVb6A6p0 data-wc=34>Kim, at the time married to Kanye, entered the fray by releasing what appeared to be snippets of a phone call where Taylor seemed to consent to the use of her name in Famous.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUgMUEjEtbA data-wc=51>This move, intended to defend Kanye, only added fuel to the fire, with Taylor accusing the couple of deceitful behavior. "She totally approved that, she wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn't," Kim alleged in a GQ interview, encapsulating the deeply entangled and public nature of their disagreement.</p><p id=eS3xVSiH_dtM data-wc=32>Ge<strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
