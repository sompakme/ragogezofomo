I’m very loyal. I think I’m intelligent,” Lewinsky answered with a nervous laugh. “I think I certainly feel that I have been misportrayed in the last year.”</p><p>Walters also asked: “What will you tell your children when you have them?”</p><p>Lewinsky replied: “Mommy made a big mistake.”</p><p>Walters was quick to respond: “And that is the understatement of the year.”</p><p>Lewinsky also used the time to apologize to the Clinton family, especially Hillary and <a href=#>Chelsea</a>.</p><h2>VLADIMIR PUTIN</h2><p>Walters cut to the chase when she spoke with the Russian president in November 2001.</p><p>It marked the first time President Putin was interviewed by an American journalist&nbsp;since the <a href=#>terrorist attacks on September 11</a>.</p><p>“Have you ever ordered anyone killed?” she asked bluntly.</p><p>Through a translator, Putin simply answered “Nyet” - Russian for “No.”</p><h2>HILLARY CLINTON</h2><p>During her annual Most Fascinating People in 2012, Walters asked <a href=#>Hillary Clinton</a> about her future plans after it was announced that she was stepping down as United States Secretary of State.</p><p>While others expected Clinton to ride off into the sunset, Walters wasn’t so sure.</p><p>She asked Clinton what would convince her to start a second presidential run in 2016 after losing the Democratic nomination to <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> in 2008.</p><p>Clinton answered: “You know, that’s all hypothetical because right now I have no intention of running.”</p><p>However, Clinton would eventually run in 2016, claiming the Democratic nomination before losing to Republican opponent <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>.</p><h2>SHAH MOHAMMAD REZA PAHLAVI</h2><p>Two years before he was overthrown, Walters interviewed the Shah at his palace in <a href=#>Iran</a> in 1977.</p><p>Mohammad Reza described himself as a “progressive” Shah, giving women equal rights, and supporting women’s right to vote and freely choose their profession.</p><p>However, when Walters asked him “Do you think women can rule?” the Shah was hesitant.</p><p>He said women lacked men’s intelligence and abilities but his wife, Farah Diba, shockingly resisted his point.</p><p>“I don’t think you really believe that,” said Diba. “But what have men done to the world, really?”</p><h2>KATHARINE HEPBURN</h2><p>A comically offbeat moment with actress Katharine Hepburn in 1981 showed Walters’ ability to spin questions on a dime.</p><p>During the interview, Hepburn mentioned to Walters that she sees herself as a tree.</p><p>Without missing a beat, the iconic “What kind of tree are you, if you think you’re a tree?” question was asked.</p><p>Hepburn, who was equally quick-witted, understood the line of questioning and said she’d be an oak.</p><h2>MIKE TYSON</h2><p>In a controversial interview with <a href=#>boxing</a> champ <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a> and his then-wife Robin Givens, Walters asked point blank if the rumors of Tyson’s alleged abuse were true.</p><p>“Does he hit you?” Walters asked in the tense interview.</p><p>“He shakes. He pushes, he swings. Sometimes I think he’s trying to scare me. There were times when it happened when I thought I could, after, handle it, you know,” Givens answered.</p><p>“And just recently, I’ve become afraid. I mean, very, very much afraid.”</p><p>A week after the interview, Givens filed for divorce.</p><h2>ROBERT AND MICHELLE SMITHDAS</h2><p>Not every person Walters interviewed was an A-List celebrity or head of state.</p><p>In 1998, she sat down with Robert and Michelle Smithdas, a married couple who were both blind and deaf.</p><p>Walters asked Robert to describe his wife despite never actually seeing her before.</p><p>“First of all, she is petite and rather delicate, very delicate bone structure.”</p><p>She turned to Michelle to ask her the poignant question: “Do you think [being blind and deaf] happened to you for a reason?”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“No, I do not question it,” Michelle replied. “I should say that I am rather happy for what I am able to do and for what I have.”</p><p>Walters considered the couple her “most memorable interview.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/971d2285-155f-4bbd-a5f1-9b7e70a622ac.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/6dedcf56-4e18-4dbb-9067-137130039074.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/file-in-thirteen-months-since-1204911-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYGeAeoKWaJmaqpKWv6J51pqjrZ2iqHqqr86noJxloaqytMDIqKWsZaahrqW1zKKpZqilqbavecuenpqbqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-who-fell-to-earth-costume-designer-was-87.html><span>←</span><span>'Man Who Fell to Earth' Costume Designer Was 87</span></a>
