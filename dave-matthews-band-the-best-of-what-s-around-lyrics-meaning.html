 Sep 11th 2018 !⃝ Hey my friend
It seems your eyes are troubled
Care to share your time with me
Would you say you're feeling low and so

See you and me
Have a better time than most can dream
Have it better than the best
So we can pull on through"><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
