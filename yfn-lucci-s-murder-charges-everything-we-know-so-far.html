In the 911 call, a woman requests an ambulance,&nbsp;saying that she saw a man clinging to a white SUV before being shoved out into the street.

Atlanta Fire and Rescue attempted to give medical aid to Adams at the crime scene, but he was pronounced dead&nbsp;at the scene.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>During this time, a second gunshot victim showed up at the Atlanta Fire Station on Lee Street, which was not far from the scene of the original crime. This second victim, identified as 32-year-old Kevin Wright, was conscious but refused to answer any questions about what happened to him. Authorities believe the two shootings are related.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>The police later named three suspects in connection with the murder, one of them being YFN Lucci. The other two suspects, Ra’Von Boyd and Leroy Pitts, were caught shortly after the shooting, but Lucci remained hidden from the police until January 13th.</span></p><p>Jerritt Clark/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><span>Shortly after the shooting, Boyd, 23, and Pitts, 17, went to South Florida to evade police custody but were eventually found by the Miami-Dade Police Department. Boyd and Pitts both face charges that are similar to YFN Lucci’s, including </span><span>felony murder, aggravated assault, participation in criminal street gang activity, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><br></span></p><p><h2>Turning Himself In</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>On Tuesday, January 11th, Atlanta police released a statement saying <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">they were looking for the public’s assistance in finding 29-year-old Rayshawn Bennett, popularly known as YFN Lucci</a>. In the statement, Atlanta Police Department Captain Jason Smith details the charges against Bennett, which include </span><span>felony murder, aggravated assault, participation in street gang activity, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. A $5,000 reward was offered for Bennett’s arrest and indictment, encouraging the public to reach out with any information they might have on his whereabouts.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Two days later, on Wednesday, January 13th at 4:39 pm, YFN Lucci took to Twitter to promote the release of a new music video. After posting the video, Lucci’s Twitter mentions were flooded with users asking about the arrest warrant, commenting things like “They looking for you” and “My mans outch here tweeting like he ain’t wanted for a whole felony murder charge.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Late Wednesday night, only a few hours after dropping the new video, YFN Lucci&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">reportedly turned himself in to Atlanta police in connection to the murder.</a> Bennett is currently being held in Fulton County Jail until further notice, and any attempts to reach Lucci or his label directly have been unsuccessful so far. His attorney Thomas Reynolds had no comment, saying, “</span><span>the presumption of innocence is a fundamental constitutional right for every citizen. Beyond this, we have no further comment at this time.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><h2>Victim’s Relationship To YFN Lucci & Lucci's Alleged Role</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>On Friday (January 15) new details emerged regarding Lucci's role in the accused murder. It is being reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the AP</a> that the fatal victim in the shooting was a member of YFN Lucci’s crew. Lucci&nbsp;was allegedly behind the wheel, acting as the driver, when&nbsp;they apparently drove through rival gang territory on the night of December 10th. Two people inside Lucci’s car opened fire on the rival gang, and&nbsp;their rivals&nbsp;fired back, hitting James Adams in the head. Someone in Lucci’s vehicle then reportedly “manually ejected” Adams from the vehicle, where he was left to die.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><strong><span>Lucci’s attorney, Drew Findling, maintains that there is no evidence to incriminate Lucci. He told ABC News that a </span><span>“review of the initial evidence” provided “no basis for any criminal charges.”</span></strong></span></p><p><h2><strong>YFN Lucci Denied Bond&nbsp;</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>On Friday (January 15) morning, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">YFN Lucci attended a bail hearing over Zoom</a>&nbsp;from the Atlanta jail he is currently being held in. In this bail hearing, Lucci’s attorney Drew Findling attempted to argue that Lucci was in no way an aggravator of the assault and murder that occurred and that he should not be found liable for these crimes as the driver of the vehicle. Prosecutor Cara Convery then detailed the rapper’s role in the aggravated assault and subsequent felony murder, which included him allowing those in his vehicle to get out and fire shots, as well as allowing them to push James Adams out of the vehicle, where he would succumb to his injuries.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>The prosecutor says that there is more than enough evidence to continue moving forward with the case and to find probable cause for YFN Lucci’s involvement. Lucci was denied bond during this hearing and will remain in custody.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjaH10fJVmsJ%2BmXaHCpK%2FIrGSmraKZsrN5wqGYq5%2BVqHqmwsSrsK2gmaO0bsPEZqKnp6diwLB5xZqpZqaVrMA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-emta-mac-address.html><span>←</span><span>What is eMTA MAC address?</span></a>
