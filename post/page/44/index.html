Owen Hart is one of wrestling’s all time greats. His ability to put on clinics earned him the praise of fans and peers alike. Sadly, the “King of Harts” passed away after a botched entrance attempt at WWE’s “Over the Edge” PPV in 1999.
His legacy continues to live on through his family and wrestlers who say Owen was the man they looked up to growing up. Wrestling fans are already rejoicing over the Owen Hart Cup, a tournament dedicated to the memory of the late great wrestler.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/43/>← Prev Page</a>
