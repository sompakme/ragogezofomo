A conservative member of the United Kingdom’s parliament promised to propose a bill in short order that would strip Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle of their royal titles—what he calls the “nuclear option.”
Writing in The Mail on Sunday, Bob Seely blamed the pair for the recent royal racism controversy, which kicked into overdrive last week when the identities of two senior members of the family who allegedly raised questions about Harry and Meghan’s then-unborn son’s skin color were outed in the Dutch translation of author Omid Scobie’s book, Endgame.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dan Paladin Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

Many laud the sartorial magic that was made when Meg Ryan worked with Nora Ephron on rom-coms set amid the falling leaves. A perfect example is You’ve Got Mail, which follows independent bookstore owner Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) and chain bookstore owner Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) as they go from public enemies to internet pen-pals then lovers. This film is loved year-round, but seems to make extra appearances in November thanks to its iconic “Happy Thanksgiving back” scene, in which Joe saves Kathleen from a line of irritated shoppers by charming a cash-only cashier (played by Sara Ramirez) into letting her check out with a credit card.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nicki Minaj's Sister Tells The Barbz To Keep Her Out Of Megan Thee Stallion Beef</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

The 2024 Oscars began six minutes late on Sunday when pro-Palestine protesters stopped traffic en route to the ceremony, blocking attendees in their cars on Hollywood’s Highland Avenue and calling into question if all of the night’s nominees would arrive at the event.
The demonstrators brought traffic at the intersection of Sunset and Highland to a complete standstill for more than 30 minutes, according to those caught in the disruption, causing some people to leave their vehicles and begin walking toward the event.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/52/>← Prev Page</a>
