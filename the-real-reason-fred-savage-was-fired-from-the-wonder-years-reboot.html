Back in 1993, when Savage was only 16, women on the set of the original "The Wonder Years" accused him of various improprieties, resulting in at least one lawsuit. One woman who worked on&nbsp;Fox's "The Grinder" (2015-2016)&nbsp;complained that Savage had struck her during a <a href=#>costume</a> fitting and "hurled profanities" at the women on set.&nbsp;The lawsuit was ultimately settled out of court. In 2015, Savage's behavior on "The Grinder" sparked another harassment lawsuit, also settled out of court (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Deadline</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>Per The Hollywood Reporter, one woman said that Savage's relationships with women much younger than him (he was 46 and married with three children at the time) made her "uneasy." Another woman claimed that Savage would "belittle" her and verbally harass her. When 20th Television got wind of the allegations,&nbsp;they investigated and then made the decision to let him go. "Recently, we were made aware of allegations of inappropriate conduct by Fred Savage ... [Upon completion of our investigation] the decision was made to terminate his employment as an executive producer and director of 'The Wonder Years,'" the network said in a statement (via&nbsp; <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>).</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
