(In other words, they're not just playing "someone's mom/wife").&nbsp;</p><p>"Of course women in their forties can dress sexy," Amy told Tina in conversation with&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2015/12/tina-fey-amy-poehler-cover referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Glamour</a>. "And, you know, the term sexy is very subjective."</p><p>"By the time you are in your forties, what you want to wear and what you think is sexy is not always, like, for another person. It's what makes you feel good," Tina agreed. "Sexy is all relative."</p><p>Sexy is relative, yes, but what if we lived in a world where people weren't judged on their looks? "I think I tried it as an exercise one time," Amy said. "I was saying, 'Oh, she's that really funny person.' Or, 'He's that guy who has that great science mind' so you don't say, like, 'He's the tall one'; 'She's whatever.' And then, if you look in the mirror, you don't say, 'How do I look?' It's almost impossible."</p><p>So, what have we learned? 1) We are all sexy. 2) But whatever, being sexy doesn't even matter. 3) Tina Fey and Amy Poehler rule.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VeuHYvZrNhjrFECqrBVQHB-1920-80.gif><p><strong>Follow&nbsp;</strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://instagram.com/marieclairemag referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><strong>Marie Claire on Instagram</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for the latest celeb news, pretty pics, funny stuff, and an insider POV.</strong></p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
