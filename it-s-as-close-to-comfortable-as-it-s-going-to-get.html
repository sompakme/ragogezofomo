Her comedic background only helps her be a better dramatic actress, she thinks. “I believe that the best dramas have moments of comedy and levity and the best comedies have moments of real depth, and emotional depth.” She argues these types of multi-dimensional roles are becoming more widespread because, “that’s what audiences are coming to expect. As an actor, you can find a role that has both.”</p><p>The conversation switched to sex and nudity on camera, as her “show is about sex!” On nudity, she has decided, “It still isn’t my favorite thing to do at work. It’s never one hundred percent comfortable, but I think it’s as close as it’s going to get.”</p><p>What’s next for Caplan? “I’d like to start working with some really good directors,” she says, “because I haven’t done all that many films, let alone those actually, really good films,” noting<strong> </strong>The Cohen Brothers and <strong>Wes</strong> <strong>Anderson</strong> as her top picks.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Inline%20Graphics%20(Product%20Only)/2015/Emmy%20Awards/THR_Emmys2015-embedPromo.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Caplan joined fellow actresses <strong>Maggie Gyllenhaal</strong> (The Honourable Woman), <strong>Ruth Wilson</strong> (The Affair), <strong>Taraji P.
