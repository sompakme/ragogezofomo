It was really, really insane.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Patel specifically remembered what he called “one of the best days of shooting” because of a specific song the crew played during the shoot.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They played&nbsp;Shy FX&nbsp;‘Original Nutter’ and they had this club scene and everyone was just going mental,” the Lion actor explained. “I remember that because they played like 60 times and I was like a Kenyan dude in the Maasai Mara jumping up and down.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The controversial British show Skins went on to air for seven seasons total before wrapping up in 2013.

At the time, several advertisers withdrew&nbsp;from MTV due to the show, and executives at then-MTV parent Viacom also ordered <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/hskins-pushing-mtv-73694/>producers to&nbsp;tone down</a>&nbsp;the series’ content ahead of its premiere, as they were worried about violating child pornography laws.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnZyvZaCWwaa4jKKlrJmemnq0t8inqmarmKTEbrzAq6uinaNifnN%2FlHFtcHBiaHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amber-rose-gets-wiz-khalifa-s-face-tattooed-on-her-arm.html><span>←</span><span>Amber Rose Gets Wiz Khalifa's Face Tattooed On Her Arm</span></a>
