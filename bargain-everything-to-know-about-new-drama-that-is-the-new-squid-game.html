However, a huge earthquake leads everyone - from the sellers to the bidders and the victims - all fighting for survival, not just from the wreckage of the earthquake, but from each other.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWQZhu0qd609 data-wc=44>Chatting to NME about the show, director Jeon Woo-sung said: "All the characters in the series are rogues and villains. I wanted to make the earthquake a punishment for them and I wanted to show how they’d react to this kind of natural disaster."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bdc6e4564825-screenshot-2023-10-04-at-124633.png><p id=eqWbAPl9S4TH data-wc=78>Speaking about whether the show had similarities to Squid Game, he added: "I think all Korean filmmakers are thinking about capitalism and how, in Korean society, no one actually backs you up and you have to survive by yourself… I think that’s the perspective all the filmmakers have in their minds and that’s why there’s that similarity. And, of course, we had to put this story and this perspective into an entertaining genre, which was tough to do."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27cc3c8b0a46-f43ssvnbmaan7so.jpg><p id=eUyIZC04dcvD data-wc=35>The show has already received praise from critics, having been awarded the best screenplay award at the Canneseries Festival in France, as well as the the critics’ choice award at the Seriencamp Festival in Cologne.</p><h3>Who is in the cast of Bargain?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eZVF3gisYnxz data-wc=42>Jeon Jong-seo stars as Park Joo Young, and is perhaps best known for her role in Money Heist: Korea.
