Showering after exercise or athletic activity can help reduce the bad-smelling effects of smells related to sweating. Putting on clean, dry clothes after a sweat session can also help.<h2>Does diet affect armpit smell?</h2>Your overall diet can also affect body odor. Some research has found that males who had a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetables had better-smelling sweat, no matter how much they sweat. On the other hand, self-reports showed that high carb intake was associated with less pleasant smelling sweat.<h2>Can poor diet cause BO?</h2>While most common body odour is caused by the presence of bacteria on our skin metabolizing the proteins and sugars in our sweat, our diet or the foods we choose to eat may also determine the odour.<h2>Does dairy cause body odor?</h2>Dairy. Body odor develops when lipids secreted in your sweat are digested by bacteria on your skin, which release odorous gasses as a byproduct — lipids that comes from digesting milk, yogurt, and other dairy products.<h2>Why do my armpits stink even with deodorant?</h2>Research has found that the salts in antiperspirants can cause an imbalance of bacteria. The aluminum compounds kill off the less smelly bacteria, giving the smellier bacteria more opportunity to thrive, causing more body odour.<h2>Does lemon juice help with underarm odor?</h2>Lemon juice<p>This wonder ingredient that's readily available in every kitchen helps lower the pH level of your skin, thus killing bacteria that produce body odour. Cut a lemon in half and rub your underarms with the halves, squeezing them a bit as you go. Let it air-dry to prevent underarm odour.</p><h2>Why do my armpits smell like onions?</h2>Bacteria Love Polyester In A Special Way. When the bacteria break down the sweat they form products called thioalcohols, which have scents comparable to sulfur, onions or meat. "They're very very pungent," says Bawdon.<h2>Does drinking more water help with body odor?</h2>Make yourself a hydration station<p>We're sure you've heard this piece of advice before, but drinking water can help reduce body odor. Water flushes out bodily toxins, and when toxins go, so does body odor because toxins cause odor.</p><h2>Can eating too much sugar cause body odor?</h2>Sugar from refined foods found in the blood after eating it has been found to change the chemistry of our perspiration (in some people) when it mixes with the bacteria found on the skin. This combination may lead to changes in your odor, and the smell of your breath (since sugar is a quick food source for bacteria).<h2>Do vegans smell better?</h2>Research suggests vegetarians have more attractive and pleasant body odor compared to meat-eaters. However, specific vegan foods like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and garlic can cause body odor, too. Sulfur compounds are the biggest reason, but many biochemical components in food can affect your sweat.<h2>Does coffee cause body odor?</h2>If you take in a lot of stimulants like coffee for example, it can also have an impact on your body odor. According to Dr. Weil, coffee and tea contribute to body odor by activating the apocrine sweat glands. Additionally, coffee is dehydrating and it makes sweat, which is made mostly of water, more intense.<h2>Does protein make your sweat smell?</h2>Protein breaks down into amino acids, which the body converts into ammonia. The body then releases this ammonia through urine and sweat, which may produce an odor.<h2>Can vitamins give you body odor?</h2>The two B-vitamins that might have some connection to body odor are vitamin B-1 (thiamin) and the B vitamin choline, Jasonides tells Lucy. If taken in mega doses, thiamin is excreted not only in urine, but also through the skin, and this changes body odor.<h2>What to drink to make you smell better?</h2>"Water is not only good for us because it keeps us healthy, but it also keeps us smelling better," says Kaufman, adding that drinking water helps to flush out our bodies eliminating some of the things that cause us to smell. (It's no wonder these detox waters are so effective!)<h2>Can eggs cause body odor?</h2>Garlic, onions,egg, and cruciferous vegetables — such as broccoli and cauliflower — can cause odour,” Dr Anupam Dey, a Kolkata-based dietician says. So, if you are eating high levels of certain foods, foul-smelling compounds they contain may be excreted through your sweat glands to give an unpleasant odour.<h2>How do I stop my armpits from smelling without deodorant?</h2><p>Alternative deodorant options</p><li>Witch hazel.
