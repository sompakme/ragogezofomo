McGlashan was a 7th generation fisherman, and he first appeared on "Deadliest Catch" in 2013, showing up in 78 episodes. McGlashan had been fishing since he was 13, and he was a fan favorite on the series, offering comedic quips and showing off his skills.</p><p dir=ltr>McGlashan had a history of alcohol and substance abuse, which impacted the show. He was suspended from part of the 13th season while he was in rehab. His usage was said to involve consuming two bottles of vodka, one gram of meth, and two grams of heroin in a single day. He worked to get sober, and he was helpful in getting other people close to him sober, but ultimately, he succumbed to his addictions.</p><p dir=ltr>On December 27, 2020, McGlashan was found dead in a Holiday Inn in Nashville, Tennessee. Initially, the cause of death wasn't known, but an autopsy report later clarified that he died of a drug overdose "after taking a toxic mix of methamphetamine, cocaine, and fentanyl" (per <a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a>). McGlashan was 33 at the time of his death, leaving behind a daughter, Lennyn, and a son, Kane.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available.
