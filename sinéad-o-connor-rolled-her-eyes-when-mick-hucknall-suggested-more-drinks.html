The Irish singer Sinead O’Connor was best known for her emotional yet brilliantly simple cover of Prince’s Nothing Compares 2 U released in 1990.</p><p>Here, four Telegraph writers share their own tales of the <a href=#>troubled, talented and very unique star</a>...</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal">‘She spoke so quietly I had to hold my dictaphone right in front of her face to pick up that beautiful voice’</h2><p>Lisa Markwell</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Sinéad O’Connor was a rising star when Lisa Markwell met her</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Kevin Cummins/Getty Images</span></figure><p>It was 1988 and I was a very junior member of staff at Sky magazine (a now-defunct pop culture title). The editor kindly suggested I interview the rising star Sinéad O’Connor, who’d released her first album, The Lion and The Cobra, to much acclaim the year before.</p><p>She was due to appear at a music festival in Italy so I was dispatched to go with her – this was in the days before stars had huge entourages and when access to them was limited to a roundtable in a conference suite, or tightly controlled 15 minutes in a hotel suite with the PR listening in. In those days there were no banned subjects or copy approval.</p><p>We met at the airport in London – she was unmistakable, remarkable even at just 21. I was only 22 myself, with just a few short pop interviews to my name. Sinéad had a hit record and a young baby already. She wore the shaved head, white T-shirt and jeans that were already her trademark, but at that time accessorised with her son Jake’s babygro pinned to the back waistband of her jeans.</p><p>I’d shaved my head when I was 14, thinking “what a rebel” but the only people who cared were my furious headteacher and my even more furious mother. Sinéad was facing down an entire industry.</p><p>No one on that flight, or checking into that hotel, or roaming around the industry events looked anything like Sinéad. She had an extraordinary presence. Those eyes. That voice. And yet… she was reticent about being interviewed. Every time I suggested we have the sit-down chat, she’d want to do something else.</p><p>We did makeovers in her room, her trying out lipsticks and blotting the results on hotel napkins (I kept one for a long time afterwards).</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>‘Whatever she said, what created far, far more of an impression on me and one that endures is how she held herself’</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Paul Bergen/Redferns</span></figure><p>We went down to the bar – this was a ritzy hotel on Lake Garda and big names from the festival were mingling, drinks were flowing. It wasn’t long before Mick Hucknall approached – <a href=#>the Simply Red star</a> was obviously entranced by Sinéad and wanted to get to know her better. Details are a bit hazy but I remember her rolling her eyes as he suggested more drinks; she’d snake away down the bar with me in tow. Eventually something profane was said and he withdrew.</p><p>We got bored and left. She was nobody’s accessory and had a healthy disregard for playing the game, although later it proved to be the source of much anguish and bad treatment. I think she went upstairs to phone whoever was looking after Jake.</p><p>Finally, not long before we had to fly back to London, I knew I’d face my editor’s wrath unless I got an actual interview. We sat on her bed and talked for a long time but she spoke so quietly I had to hold my dictaphone right in front of her face to pick up that beautiful voice. She spoke about Jake, about home, about music but I can’t find the magazine now, and it was long before the creation of the internet, where articles live forever.</p><p>Whatever she said, what created far, far more of an impression on me and one that endures is how she held herself – on the brink of the whole world clamouring for her then, to a large extent, turning away from her. Strength that never faltered, until it did.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal">‘Sinéad apologised to me for her behaviour when she was unhappy’</h2><p>Neil McCormick</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Neil with Sinead in 2014</span></figure><p>As a young musician on the Dublin scene in the 1980s, I was aware of Sinéad O’Connor long before she burst upon the world. She sang at a wedding in my home village and made her debut recording with some of my friends in the band In Tua Nua. Beautiful, elfin, with a sensuous, striking voice that could make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck, there was no doubting her preternatural talent, and it was no surprise when she rose to global stardom.</p><p>But I was aware too of a more combative, challenging side to her nature. Our first interview, in 1990, ended with us wrestling over a table for my tape recorder, with Sinéad accusing me of wanting “to make a fool of her” and me retorting that she was doing a fine job of that by herself. I fled, pursued through the record company lobby by O’Connor hurling abuse. I wasn’t in a hurry to repeat the experience, but I never stopped being a fan of her music, because I could hear how much of her volatile, combustible, emotional self there was in it.</p><p>Then, 21 years later, I accepted an invitation to her home in Bray. “I’m so sorry,” she said, discussing that early encounter. “I was a very unhappy person. Young and angry. I couldn’t understand why people liked my music, ‘cause for me the only reason I was making it was ‘cause I was mad and I had to.”</p><p>The adult Sinéad was warm, open, thoughtful, with a quick smile and intimate manner, and <a href=#>we talked for hours</a>. Her Georgian seafront house had a lovely, lived-in, family feel, and she seemed happy to have come through the other side of so many personal battles and found herself in a good and loving space, unaware of all the battles to come. I became a big fan of Sinéad the person, as well as the artist, and we stayed in touch. She may have suffered debilitating mental health issues, but she lived bravely, adhering to her own truth, with compassion and empathy for others. She was on the right side of so many big issues, <a href=#>history will surely reflect upon her kindly</a>. The music speaks for itself.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal">‘Success was never what Sinéad was after’</h2><p>Suzanne Moore</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Her gigs were phenomenal. “I just wanted to scream,” she said.</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Amelia Troubridge/Contour by Getty Images</span></figure><p>When you hear her voice, it can be no other. Too often these days Sinéad O’Connor is spoken about as a tragic figure. Her struggles with mental health acted out in public. The loss of her son and her desperate appeals to find him when he went missing were gut-wrenching. To so many people now she must come across as nothing but a sad and troubled woman. Or, as she said herself, “a crazy bitch”.</p><p>I was at the edge of the scene she was part of in the 1980s – The Pogues started in the flat I lived in – and all we ever knew about her was that she was astonishing and… well, “awkward” was the word used most often about her. But wasn’t everyone “difficult” back then? Wasn’t that what punk was all about? Still, things were always different for girls.</p><p>In London, Sinéad found her people – the tribes of the gay community, who adored her and dressed her; the punks, whose attitude she embodied; and the Rastas, who saw the Catholic church as a theocracy and the Pope as the Devil himself.</p><p>Her gigs were phenomenal. “I just wanted to scream,” she said.</p><p>Success was never what Sinéad was after. Or material things. She saw herself as a protest singer, an activist, a punk as much as an artist. And there was always that voice. Aching, Keening. Roaring. Always the voice.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal">‘I feared for her, even as I admired her’</h2><p>Mick Brown</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Uli Weber/Contour by Getty Images</span></figure><p>When I met Sinéad O’Connor in 1992, it was a few days after she had appeared in front of 18,000 people at Madison Square Garden in New York, at a concert to pay tribute to Bob Dylan, to be greeted with jeers and boos.</p><p>“So much bile, and so much hatred coming up,” she recalled. “It just made me want to throw up and that’s when I cried.”</p><p>It was two weeks after her appearance on the television programme Saturday Night Live, when singing Bob Marley’s song War she had departed from the script – popular singer, playing nice – and tore up a picture of the Pope, shouting “fight the real enemy”.</p><p>There was an outcry, of course. A group called the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, who had staged a public demonstration in which her CDs were crushed by a steamroller and a plea was made for America to be made a “Sinéad O’Connor Free” zone.</p><p>But it should not have come as a surprise. In 1990, <a href=#>when Nothing Compares to U was on its way to selling a million copies</a>, she had refused to allow a Stars and Stripes to be unfurled at a concert in America, in protest against censorship of the arts, provoking Frank Sinatra to suggest she should have her ass kicked. And in Dublin she had been arrested for trying to enter the Irish parliament to protest over the Supreme Court’s decision to refuse a 14-year-old girl an abortion.</p><p>Now, small and slight, she sat hunched on a sofa, drawing on a cigarette, her finger moving across the table in front of her as her conversation veered along a line from the iniquities of the Holy Roman Empire and its “distortion of history”, to the idolatory of money – “the root of all evil” – to what she considered its most tangible manifestation: child abuse.</p><p>“The reason people are angry with me,” she said, “is because what I said was the truth. The point I was making by ripping up the picture of the Pope, was that we are not in contact with God. The proof of that is the existence in the world of child-abuse, starvation, alcoholism, homelessness”.</p><p>Rock music has always been fond of its martyrs, but more usually they fall to a surfeit of drugs and excess. Controversy is good for business – as countless stars from the Stones to Madonna had proved. But conviction, particularly a conviction so determinedly confrontational, is another matter altogether.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>In London, Sinéad found her people</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: SGranitz/WireImage</span></figure><p>With her shaved head, wide, startled eyes, the burning fervency of her conversation that brooked no interruption, the thing I was most put in mind of were the mediaeval religious zealots, who warned against the destruction of the world through sin and followed the path of penance and flagellation.</p><p>Those zealots flagellated their bodies. O’Connor was flagellating her career. “This is no time for writing songs,” she said. What she wanted to do now was to stop performing and launch a campaign for everyone to “go back to God, to get out in the streets and say: ‘No more violence, no more manifestation of evil in any way, and in the name of God get rid of the thing which took God away from us, which is money’”.</p><p>Get rid of money? We were sitting in the offices of her record company – the very heart&nbsp;of Mammon. “I could get rid of my money,’ she went on, “but as long as there is money in the world, if I get rid of mine my own family will starve. If everyone gets rid of all their money, no-one is going to starve. That’s all we need to do: press delete.”</p><p>She had planned to hold a press conference later that day, she told me, at which she would be making her plea for everyone to renounce money and renew her attack on the Holy Roman Empire. It was cancelled.</p><p>I’m shocked, looking back at what I wrote then, that her conviction, almost messianic,&nbsp;bordered on an intensity that made you suspect something almost unhinged. Not a word I would dream of using now. I hope she never read it.</p><p>But it was clear that she was mentally fragile, and I feared for her, even as I admired her – for her talent, her idealism and her determination to say what she believed, and to hell with the consequences.</p><p>“People are asleep, and it’s time to wake up,” she said. “Because if not, we’re all going to be destroyed.”</p><p>That was 31 years ago. Different times but still the same issues, and more. “It’s time to wake up.” She was right about that.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">What did Sinéad O’Connor mean to you?
