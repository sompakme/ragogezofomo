The track features an AI-generated clone of Drake’s voice and Abel Makkonen Tesfaye’s (The Weeknd) vocals. It is unknown who published the now-viral song, though a TikTok user known as “Ghostwriter” shared it. Many have been left speculating about the person behind the song’s creation.</p><p>https://youtu.be/VszJPLAtK0U</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=8b4869a0-df88-4a4c-a78d-be6003c1335c>The song is about the well-known actress and singer Selena Gomez, who had previously been in a relationship with The Weeknd. The lyrics reference her, with the fake Drake rapping, “I came in with my ex like Selena to flex.” The verse then mentions Justin Bieber, Gomez’s ex-boyfriend, with the clone of Drake saying, “Bumpin’ Justin Bieber, the fever ain’t left me.”</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=195b816e-6b1e-432e-8359-a3cc4658e107>Meanwhile, the fake AI-generated clone of The Weeknd also sings about Gomez, with the lyrics, “Got these pearls on my neck, got these girls on my cheek like Selena baby.” Even though neither Drake nor The Weeknd was involved in creating the song, it has gained significant attention on social media platforms, with many fans sharing and enjoying the track.</p><h2 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=3e089b0e-c2dc-4f74-9dd8-8a4754e5fd82>What’s The Story Behind The AI-Generated Track?</h2><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=6dd9fce1-975b-4689-8d58-34efa90e5d17>The AI-generated collaboration between Drake and The Weeknd has been making waves online, with many fans mistaking it for the real deal. However, there may be more to the story than meets the eye. Some social media users, including Mitchell Cohen of AppSumo, have speculated that the song is a clever marketing ploy.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=6dd9fce1-975b-4689-8d58-34efa90e5d17><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/e8fc85802e.jpg alt width=1024 height=546 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=81515657-b78d-4315-a218-6a588aa44f6a>Cohen believes a tech startup, Laylo, may be behind creating the AI-generated track. He notes that the TikTok profile of the user who first shared the song, “ghostwriter977,” includes a link to a website owned by the said SaaS startup. This has led many to speculate that the music may be a way to promote the startup rather than a legitimate collaboration between the two musicians.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=e6088063-b9d6-4308-8f93-708963e10fd2>If true, this would mean that the AI-generated song featuring Drake and The Weeknd is simply a marketing tactic. Nonetheless, some have praised the strategy as a “genius” move, as it has certainly captured the attention of fans and the media alike.</p><h2 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=4d6954da-e64e-4a94-8d46-9171ed7575d0>Artificial Intelligence And The Music Industry</h2><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=96b99d25-3708-40a1-8516-b56f93772fbd>The transformative impact of AI technology is making its presence felt in the music industry, where it is revolutionizing the process of creating music, making it faster and more efficient.
