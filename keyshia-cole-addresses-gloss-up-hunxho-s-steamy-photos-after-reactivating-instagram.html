While most fans are feeling the track, Hunxho's girlfriend <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Keyshia Cole</a> certainly isn't. The video features various shots of Gloss Up twerking on Hunxho, the two of them hanging out in a bathtub, and more. Cole and Hunxho just <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">confirmed their relationship last month</a>, so needless to say, the steamy video has fans confused.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Shortly after it came out, social media sleuths noticed that Cole deactivated her Instagram account. It didn't last long, however. Gloss Up went on to share a few photos of her and Hunxho on set, hugging and looking a bit too close for Cole's comfort. Her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">suggestive caption</a> didn't help either.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-keyshia-cole-reacts-to-gloss-up-s-ig-post>Keyshia Cole Reacts To Gloss Up's IG Post</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You Know What It Is In Real Life . 4L StinkaLink ü´∂üèæ 'Come Here' Out Now Link In Bio," she wrote. Upon seeing this, Keyshia Cole reactivated her account to make it clear that she wasn't feeling the post. "Him being Yo 'sneaky link' When U have a "Man you bout to marry' is nasty work," she said alongside some laughing emojis. "But I wish u all the best on your project Love I was actually rooting for the video to come out." At this point, it remains unclear how Hunxho feels about all of this. He did share one brief yet telling Tweet about the debacle recently, writing <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Y'all hell [laughing emoji.]"</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to Keyshia, the photos were taken before she and Hunxho were official, but Gloss Up <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">continues to taunt her</a> on Twitter/X. She recently retweeted a post claiming that Hunxho "was gloss up man first." What do you think of Gloss Up's new video and photos with Hunxho? What about Keyshia Cole's reaction to it?
