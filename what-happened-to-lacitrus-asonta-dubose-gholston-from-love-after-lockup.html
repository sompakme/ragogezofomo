This transformation raised many questions among fans, and we’re here to unravel the mystery behind it.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The Mysterious Zombie Transformation In episode 22, viewers witnessed Sternritter Z’s incredible powers. However, the most jaw-dropping moment was when Mayuri summoned Arrancars to confront the zombies created by Giselle. Despite his efforts, Giselle managed to acquire a formidable zombie, none other than Toshiro Hitsugaya.</p><p>How Did Toshiro Hitsugaya Become a Zombie? The last time we saw Toshiro was in episode 16, where he fought valiantly against Cang Du but ended up collapsing from exhaustion. Little did he know that his moment of weakness would make him vulnerable to a sinister plot. Sternritter Giselle took advantage of his weakened state and transformed him into a zombie. But how did she do it?</p><p>The Zombie Transformation Process Giselle’s ability to turn individuals into zombies is indeed chilling. She approached Toshiro when he lay unconscious, making it easier to carry out her sinister plan. The process required Toshiro to have low Reiatsu, which made the transformation smoother for Giselle.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Toshiro’s Fate as a Zombie In episode 22, we witnessed Toshiro Hitsugaya under the control of Giselle Gewelle. He had no free will and obeyed her every command, even attacking his own comrades. The question on everyone’s mind is whether Toshiro will remain a zombie forever.</p><p>Hope for Toshiro Hitsugaya The good news for fans is that Toshiro’s fate as a zombie is not sealed. In the upcoming episodes, Mayuri will play a crucial role in his recovery. Mayuri will engage in a fierce battle with Toshiro, the Arrancars, and other Soul Reapers.</p><p>Mayuri’s Plan to Save Toshiro Mayuri will unveil a strategy to reclaim control over the zombies from Giselle. He’ll reveal a drug capable of altering the blood composition, using the Gotei 13 as a foundation. This drug will enable Mayuri to take control away from Giselle and provide Toshiro with a chance at redemption.</p><p>Toshiro’s Painful Road to Recovery In a cunning move, Mayuri injects Toshiro’s zombie form with a drug that inflicts excruciating agony. This pain is a necessary step in the process of de-zombification. Toshiro, along with Rangiku, will be placed in a specialized container to reverse the effects of zombification. However, this treatment comes at a cost—the shortening of their lifespans.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Toshiro Hitsugaya’s Lifeline Despite the challenges ahead, Toshiro Hitsugaya is far from being declared dead. Giselle explains that those turned into zombies while alive possess better mobility and reaction speeds due to their fresh cells. After Giselle’s defeat and Mayuri’s intervention, Toshiro will gradually regain his normal state. Although he may lose some of his lifespan in the process, the fact remains that he’s alive and ready to face new challenges.</p><p>Toshiro’s Formidable Future As the story unfolds, Toshiro Hitsugaya’s journey takes a new and unexpected turn. He’ll remain a formidable opponent, even for Mayuri and the Arrancars. So, fans, rest assured that there are still plenty of battles ahead for our beloved Toshiro.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>the recent transformation of Toshiro Hitsugaya into a zombie in Bleach: TYBW has left fans both shocked and intrigued. However, there is hope on the horizon as Mayuri takes on the challenge of saving Toshiro and returning him to his former self. The journey ahead promises more action, suspense, and surprises, making Bleach: TYBW an anime series worth watching.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxxhY6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeq2twqKrq62jYq60u82tmGacpZe8tLGMoJ%2BopKOpvK95xaumpmWcpMOmecCfq56qXaG8pLfUqWWhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-alison-in-pretty-little-liars.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Alison In Pretty Little Liars?</span></a>
