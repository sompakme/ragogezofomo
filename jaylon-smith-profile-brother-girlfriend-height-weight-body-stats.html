He signed a 4-year rookie contract worth $6.49 million dollars with a signing bonus of $2.9 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>The famous American footballer may not be the NFL’s richest player, but his net worth is estimated at $9 million.&nbsp;At present, details of his assets, which include both real estate and automobiles, are not publicly available.&nbsp;As he is still at the beginning of his career, you can expect his total net worth to increase in the coming years.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jaylon Smith’s Brother: Rod Smith</span></strong></h2><p><span>Dallas Cowboys running back Rod Smith is Jaylon Smith’s older brother.&nbsp;The two brothers attended different high schools and once faced each other.&nbsp;The match which was won by Jaylon’s team with a score of 14-8 gave him the eternal bragging rights of his big brother.</span></p><p><span>Jaylon said watching his older brother achieve fame and success made him want to succeed as well.&nbsp;Like all younger brothers, he always strived to be better than his big brother and step out of his shadow.</span></p><p><span>Their father, Roger Smith, describes his two sons as part of the same team, a source of pride for his family.&nbsp;According to Roger, it’s a bit surreal, especially since the Dallas Cowboys are his favorite NFL team.&nbsp;What more could a father ask for than his boys to have the opportunity to achieve their dreams and aspirations?</span></p><p><span>Although the brothers are very close now, that hasn’t always been the case.&nbsp;ESPN’s Elizabeth Merrill once shared that the two brothers once had a falling out and were no longer close because of it.&nbsp;It was also reported that Rod left a mark on Jaylon’s face during a fight when they were younger.</span></p><p><span>The good news is that they are currently on good terms, although their competitive edge hasn’t diminished yet, despite being teammates.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life and girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jaylon Smith is currently in a romantic relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Nevada Jones, who is a fellow athlete.&nbsp;Nevada Jones was a basketball player during her college years at Indiana University, Kokomo, a public university in Indiana.</span></p><p><span>Nevada has always been supportive of her, which is why it’s wonderful to see Jaylon Smith celebrate his girlfriend and stay true to her.&nbsp;It’s no secret that it has become common to cheat on men as soon as they become famous.&nbsp;Fortunately, this is not the case with Jaylon.</span></p><p><span>For its part, Nevada is known to be a private person and does not want to divulge any personal information to the curious public.&nbsp;Even though she is on social media, she remains silent on information regarding her private affairs.</span></p><p><strong><span>Also Read: Le’Veon Bell Biography, Offense Status, Why Was He Suspended?&nbsp;Here are all the facts</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight, body stats</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jaylon can easily be described as a tall man, standing at a height of 1.88 m (6 ft 2 in) with a corresponding body weight of 111 kg (245 lb).&nbsp;Information regarding his general body stats is not known.</span></p><p><span>As a professional athlete, being in good shape is necessary;&nbsp;and as such, we can say that Jaylon Smith is in excellent shape, which he easily maintains thanks to his career choice.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiika65sLqMrKSirJhivbO7xaKjnmWSp7y1tMSrZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmoJWetKnAjLCcop%2BYqXqju8OyZKyskanAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./georgia-tennant-net-worth-details-about-movies-shows-tattoo-age-tv-sarkariresult.html><span>←</span><span>Georgia Tennant Net Worth: Details About Movies, Shows, Tattoo, Age, TV - SarkariResult</span></a>
