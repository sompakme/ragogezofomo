In the first series, Miranda was only meant to stay on the island for a short time but ends up staying on with the Palma police department.

"It's the reward you get if you watch from episode one to episode ten. I think audiences will get very emotionally attached to these two characters."</p><h2>Maria Fernández-Ache as Inés Villegas</h2><p id=ejJZ-0sFe6X9 data-wc=26>Inés Villegas is the glamorous but no-nonsense chief of police in Palma. She oversees Miranda and Max's investigations - as well as their constant culture clashes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bf61b9114cde-maria-fernandez-ache-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eqQu-AyNmsUr data-wc=5><strong>Maria Fernández-Ache as Inés Villegas</strong></p><p id=edYTcxMss1-9 data-wc=38>She is played by Spanish actress Maria Fernández-Ache who has appeared on both Spanish and English television.

They're both free spirits and love life, wine and music. She is a woman who comes across as strong, but we will see a vulnerable side to her as well. <strong>She's also very useful to Max in some of his investigations, which are about people she knows."</strong></p><h2>Alex Hafner as Roberto Herrero&nbsp;</h2><p id=exd0GuxYA4VQ data-wc=50>actor Alex Hafner stars as Roberto Herrero, a forensic scientist who assists Max and Miranda with their investigations in series two of the show.
