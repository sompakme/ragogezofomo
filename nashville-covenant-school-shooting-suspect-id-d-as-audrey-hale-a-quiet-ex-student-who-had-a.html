<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Nashville Covenant School Shooting Suspect IDd as Audrey Hale, a Quiet Ex-Student Who Had a</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The suspect accused of <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>storming a private Christian school in Nashville</a> on Monday morning, killing three kids and three adults, has been identified as a “quiet” 28-year-old former art student who may have been fueled by “resentment” towards their former school.</p><p>The Nashville Metro Police Department identified the suspect as Audrey Elizabeth Hale, who was shot dead by cops just 14 minutes after The Covenant School called police to report an active shooter. The victims were identified as students Evelyn Dieckhaus, <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Hallie Scruggs</a>, and William Kinney, all aged 9, as well as head of school Katherine Koonce, 60, substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61, and school custodian Mike Hill, 61.</p><p>A source close to the Hale family told The Daily Beast on Monday night that Hale was autistic “but high-functioning.”</p><p>“And relatively recently announced she was transgender, identifying as he/him,” the source said, asking to remain unnamed so as to avoid additional family strife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop><p>While police initially described the suspect as a 28-year-old white woman, a LinkedIn profile, which the source confirmed to The Daily Beast as belonging to Hale, listed he/him pronouns. Nashville Police Chief John Drake said at a press conference Monday afternoon that Hale was transgender.</p><p>A search of Hale’s home turned up “maps drawn of the school, in detail, so, surveillance, entry points, et cetera,” Drake said, as well as a “manifesto” and “some writings that pertain to this date, the actual incident... of how this was all going to take place.” Inside a Honda Fit that Hale drove and parked at the church-based school’s campus Friday morning, cops found “additional material written by Hale,” police said in a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>tweet</a>.</p><p>Speaking to <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>NBC News</a>, Drake suggested that “resentment for having to go to that school” may have been a factor in the attack. While he did not elaborate on the possible motive, he said Hale “targeted random students... Whoever she came in contact with, she fired rounds.”</p><p>Covenant, which has about 200 students in preschool to sixth grade, was the only school that was targeted, he said. A second location was mentioned but later abandoned “because of a threat assessment by the suspect, too much security.”</p><p>Minutes before the shooting, Hale sent a series of dark Instagram messages to a friend, who shared them with <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>WTVF</a>. “You’ll probably hear about me on the news after I die,” read <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>one message sent to Averianna Patton</a>, a former middle school basketball teammate of Hale’s. “This is my last goodbye. I love you. See you again in another life.”</p><p>Hale arrived at the school armed with an AR-style rifle, an AR-style pistol, and a handgun—and used the guns to shoot through a locked side entrance, Drake said. Two of the guns were “obtained legally, locally here,” he said. Photos and <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>body-cam video</a> from the scene showed Hale wearing camo print pants, a tactical-style vest, and wielding <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>personalized guns</a>, including one that had “Aiden” written on it, a name Hale used on some social media profiles.</p><p>Reached by phone, Hale’s mother, Norma Fort Hale, who works at a nondenominational church in Nashville, told an ABC News reporter, “It’s very difficult now, we ask for privacy. I really can’t talk right now, I think I lost my daughter today.”</p><p>A LinkedIn profile says Audrey Hale started a freelance illustration and graphic design business last year after attending Nossi College of Art & Design in Madison, Tennessee.</p><p>In a statement, the college confirmed Hale was a 2022 graduate but clarified Hale did not work for the college, as social media profiles suggested. “While at our school, she was a talented artist and a good student. Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family, to the victims and their families and to our city,” the school’s president and CEO Cyrus Vatandoost said.</p><p>Richard Cook, who taught Hale at Nossi in the summer of 2015, told The Daily Beast that the graphic design student “would always do more work than asked” and never had any problems with other students.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hale “was a good student,” Cook said. “[Hale] was an overachiever, from what I remember. If I asked her for 20 thumbnail drawings, [Hale] did 40.”</p><p>Cook said that Hale was “on the spectrum” and that he had spoken with Norma Hale at least once during the summer session. At the end of the summer, Hale’s mother took to Facebook to post about her child’s time at Nossi—and even mentioned Cook.</p><p>“So, Audrey wrote ‘thank you’ notes to all her professors at the end of her summer semester,” Norma Fort Hale wrote in an August 2015 post. “These were some of her words to Mr. Cook, who lost his son in a car accident almost a year ago. ‘Don’t ever let anything or anyone steal your joy. You have a reason and a purpose to be here.’ Amazing, Dre. I love you.”</p><p>Cook admitted on Tuesday that he did not remember the note, but wouldn’t have put it past Hale to write him one. He added that he did not immediately recognize Hale as his former student when news broke out Monday of the mass shooting, but said he ultimately remembered after speaking to several people.</p><p>“It’s shocking,” Cook added. “But every school shooting is shocking.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hours after the shooting, police searched a home just three miles away from the school. A neighbor, Sandy Durham, who is also a family friend of the Hales, said the ATF told her they were there “to see what was going on next door [at the Hale house].”</p><p>“I do know Audrey, I’ve known her since she was a baby. I had just gotten out of the shower when all of this started happening. I didn’t really know anything more than that. Something was going on next door. It’s just tragic for everybody. The sweet children that were hurt, killed, the adults. All of it,” she told The Daily Beast.</p><p>Asked if there were any warning signs about Hale, Durham responded, “Never. She was very sweet. I don’t know what happened. It’s very scary.”</p><p>Another resident of the neighborhood, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Sean, said the Hales were “our neighbors for basically ever on that street. As long as I can really remember growing up as a kid.”</p><p>Hale was a “normal, nice person. Maybe a little quiet,” he said.</p><p>“If I had to imagine, Audrey’s parents are probably just as shocked as everybody in the neighborhood is… It just doesn’t seem real,” he said. “There’s nothing that would have led me to believe that she was capable of such a thing or that she or anybody in that family would have access to, much less ever used, a gun. They just don’t seem like the family that, like, is around guns. They’re not talking about going to a gun range or they’re not going hunting.”</p><p>He said that, growing up, his family had a basketball hoop in their driveway and Hale would come over and shoot hoops.</p><p>Another neighbor told The Daily Beast they heard a “huge boom” as police entered the family’s home.</p><p>“My son and I were having lunch around 1 o’clock, and we heard a huge boom that shook our house, and had no idea what it was,” said Abigail Ashford-Grooms, who said she lives several doors down. “And when we peeked out the door, there were undercover police cars and ambulances and fire trucks blocking the street. And then we noticed all of our neighbors start to creep out at the same time.”</p><p>Hale entered Covenant, a school of about 200 preschool to sixth-grade students, through a side entrance just after 10 a.m. Monday, police said. Hale fired multiple shots while moving from the first floor to the second, before a team of five Nashville cops arrived on scene and almost immediately confronted the shooter on the second floor. Police released <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>dramatic bodycam footage</a> of the confrontation on Tuesday morning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfo660tNWio6WdXZi8t7HNmqWtZaOYtbC7y2aqoaefqbavs4ysrKyolZjBbrXDnqWtoZaesqV5wKxkmq2Up7K6eceao54%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-the-famous-voice-actors.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Famous Voice Actors</span></a>
