Although Q is in a bit of a different lane, he certainly fits in with the artists on display here. Below, you can find the audio and music video to the song, which was released over five years ago. For some, revisiting this track is going to bring about some nostalgia. It also helps that the instrumental here has an 80s twinge to it that brings it to another level.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-westside-gunn-conway-alc-and-schoolboy-q-did-their-thing>Westside Gunn, Conway, Alc, And ScHoolboy Q Did Their Thing</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Each artist puts their best foot forward on this track and it makes for a dope cut. With the 80s-sounding instrumental hanging in the back, Gunn, Conway, and Q bring laid-back flows that still pack a punch. It is a song that makes for easy listening, and it encapsulates just how talented these individuals are.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this track, in the comments section below.
