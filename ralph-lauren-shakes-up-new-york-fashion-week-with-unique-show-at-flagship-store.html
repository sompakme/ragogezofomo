"I have always wanted a woman to fall in love with my collection and say 'I can't wait to wear it' and now she doesn't have to," Ralph said. "We are meeting her needs with even greater energy than before and delivering impeccable craftsmanship and luxury to her instantly."</p><p id=eYzHbVxlMSm7 data-wc=10><a class=hm-link href=#>GALLERY: The best street style from New York Fashion Week</a></p><p id=ek_x-gZ--3Yi data-wc=70>The designer made the show even more accessible by streaming the event live on Facebook Live and Tencet Live in China. It followed a number of changes to the New York Fashion Week schedule, with many designers including Tommy Hilfiger and Rebecca Minkoff relocating their shows to Los Angeles.

The show has already started for me. We're not in New York in February right now." Bella was also thrilled to be involved in the unique presentation, and took to Instagram to share a photo of herself strutting her stuff on the runway in an oversized tangerine dress, writing: "Thank you for having me again last night @ralphlauren. Such a beautiful show, thank you @johndavidpfeiffer."</p><p id=emgn6QlifGNA data-wc=8><strong class=redactor-inline-converted>Get all the latest&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>fashion week</a><strong class=redactor-inline-converted>&nbsp;news here.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
