Kind of. Sort of. Not really, though, if we’re being honest.
First, for those unaware, Prince Michael’s real name is Christopher Michael Harty. He was a main cast member on the first two seasons of Love and Hip Hop: Miami.
More recently, Prince Michael made headlines for an alleged scuffle with Tory Lanez and for multiple domestic violence accusations."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Sort of. Not really, though, if we’re being honest.</p><p>First, for those unaware, Prince Michael’s real name is Christopher Michael Harty. He was a main cast member on the first two seasons of Love and Hip Hop: Miami.</p><p>More recently, Prince Michael made headlines for an alleged scuffle with Tory Lanez and for multiple domestic violence accusations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1557207488-731x1024.jpg><p>Most recently, meanwhile, Michael appeared on the “We In Miami” podcast, where he asked if he had “smashed” any celebrities, prompting the 34-year-old to drop one name in particular.</p><p>“I’m probably gonna get some sh-t for this, but Lori Harvey,” Prince replied. “It wasn’t like a smash though, like I was really you know I was really like f-cking with her. She was really f-cking with me.”</p><p>Lori Harvey is the daughter of talk show host Steve Harvey.</p><p>She’s currently dating Damson Idris, although Michael said she had quite the raunchy history with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1503018901-683x1024.jpg><p>The intercourse between the pair was “phenomenal,” Michael detailed on the podcast, adding:</p><p>“She wasn’t thin like she is now. I prefer the old Lori, honestly.”</p><p>He then even confessed to trying to secretly VIDEOTAPE a sexual encounter, only for Harvey to catch him in the act.</p><p>“One time I was trying to be slick and get a video, this girl was like so on it like… She was so on it,” Michael said, admitting to be a total slimeball who may have broken the law by even attempting this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1557411421-1024x683.jpg><p>Michael went on to say he “really liked” the popular socialite, and then claimed he purposefully self-sabotaged their fling because his heart belonged to someone else.</p><p>“I had someone that I was dealing with and I loved her but I really really really liked Lori,” he shared.</p><p>The self-described Prince also blamed insecurity on their fun experience, concluding:</p><p>“You f-cking wit me? Like I can’t do sh-t for you.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1662378380-1024x722.jpg><p>As you might expect, Prince Michael has garnered A LOT of backlash for spilling all this personal tea.</p><p>In response, he’s released a lengthy message that he probably thinks is an apology… but is really an example of someone gaslighting his critics.</p><p>“Whilst I can appreciate & understand everyone’s view on the podcast, I disagree,” wrote the polarizing reality star.</p><p>“I understand the manner in which the question came off distasteful & I tried to answer in a manner that would still be funny, & salacious but still respectful, clearly I failed although I stated certain things to paint a clearer picture.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/Pince-Michael-612x1024-1.webp><p>From there, Prince Michael argued that “this is MY life, MY story, MY truth. I would never get on any public platform & just LIE or talk about a sexcapade.”</p><p>He continued:</p><p>“But whether it was public knowledge or not, I had a relationship with this person regardless if you consider it one or not. & I feel like I can speak on my past relationships.</p><p>“Had this been a hook-up or a one night stand & I was being messy I get it. But to the public knowledge y’all really only know & have seen me with Liz on LHH.</p><p>“Can I not talk about Liz ever & our relationship cuz it’s the past? Or Claudia? My most recent ex, who’s exes include a famous Cuban artist, athletes? Nah I’m not innocent, I played into the bullshit a little bit just tryna entertain y’all & I can see where I’m in the wrong, not blind.</p><p>“But this whole narrative being pushed is beyond the truth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1675303920-683x1024.jpg><p>Michael did say he’ll try to be more “tactful and mindful” in the future, while at least warning potential suitors and/or lovers.</p><p>“No one ever date me again because ima talk to someone about it at some point,” he wrote.</p><p>Hear that, ladies? Take heed.</p><p>t</p><p>s</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z9cLzRoqWcnV2itqS0wJ6jZqufp7%2B6ecWoqWaroJ65rbXNoGSapJxiwamt02ajqKqZYrWivtWesGarla16tbHAaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./serena-wolf-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Serena Wolf Net Worth 2024</span></a>
