Goodrum saw that there was drama in the relationship between Perry and his girlfriend. He was smitten with her at the time and wanted to write something about his appreciation for her sticking with him despite the difficulty of dating an internationally famous rock star, especially during the 1980s, when things could get quite ribald backstage.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the music video, a woman comes into the station where Perry is singing. That is actually Swafford, herself. She apparently never married anyone and has been keeping a low profile since the 1980s, living a normal life.&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a href=#>AllMusic</a>, after his solo success, Perry rejoined Journey for a 1987 album, but they disbanded&nbsp;shortly after. They have reunited several times since, but Perry has not toured with them. They were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2017. While he did come to the stage with his former band members, he didn't perform with them that night. The reason, via <a href=#>Ultimate Classic Rock</a>, was not due to jealousy or infighting. He felt it was current Journey singer Arnel Pineda's moment.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDknBpb3BfrLWwecisZK2glWLAtbHVnmSpnaKnxm6%2FzqeeZqeYYsCpsdGroJ5lopqurbjYZpibp6WpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-julian-mcmahon-dating-now-exploring-the-actor-s-past-and-present-relationships.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Julian McMahon Dating Now?
