One annoying thing about dating is that guys who don't act anywhere near as obsessive as Stacy get labeled as "coming on too strong" because women are very sensitive to this in the beginning.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a1987/when-does-persistence-pay-080727/>Trust me, by now I've learned to just text/call once and then give up so that I don't overwhelm in the early stages</a>.</p><p>I get a lot of hand-holding from my girl friends behind the curtain: They tell me to tread lightly in the beginning so that I don't look weird.</p><p>Among the many "rules" my girl friends tell me to follow:</p><p>In addition to the advice given to me by my many female handlers, I've heard from these same girls things guys do to come on too strong:</p><p>There must be a point where it becomes acceptable to start giving a girl more attention, and I guess it varies for everyone. I never know when it's the right time for this.</p><p>Here's the frustrating part:&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2518/men-stereotypes-women-2/>I hear women complain that a guy is coming on too strong</a>...and then complain that a guy is not giving them enough attention. There's some magic (and usually impossible to find) button in the middle somewhere that a guy has to push.</p><p>Sadly, I'm at the point where I know my chances are best if I look like I'm not thinking about a girl too much. This is my default move, because I know if I come on strong, or tell a girl I actually like her, my chances will die.</p><p>Maybe the guy who comes on too strong kills all his mystery — and I admit we all like a little mystery.</p><p>Is it boring when it's "too easy"? Do we all expect a little game to be played? Is it necessary to be vague to compel a girl in the beginning? Why do you dislike when a guy comes on too strong, and what are things they do to come on too strong?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaKuVrXqtu9WeZpptY2d9cK3RnmSyp6VisLC5yKeeZqeeYsGwu4ysq6unnpx8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-bomboclaat-sco-pa-tu-manaa-and-why-is-it-all-over-twitter.html><span>←</span><span>What is bomboclaat/sco pa tu manaa and why is it all over Twitter?</span></a>
