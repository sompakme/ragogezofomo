The site has been a go-to for fashion editors ever since it launched in 2007—and we have big feelings about it shuttering. The only upside is that the site is currently having a massive sale.</p><p>In an ode to our favorite retailer, Marie Claire’s editors have parsed through the massive selection and picked out our favorite discounted luxury pieces to shop while you still can.&nbsp;Right now, <strong>Matches is offering an extra 20 percent off nearly 5,500 pieces in its outlet section.</strong> There’s a minimum spend of $250, the discount is only available on items with the EXTRA 20% OFF button (read: most of them) and items purchased on sale are not eligible for returns or exchanges.</p><p>Our editors’ hand-picked pieces run the gamut from a bag brand carried by none other than <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/taylor-swift/><u>Taylor Swift</u></a> to the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-sweaters-for-women/><u>best sweaters</u></a> and ‘90s-inspired denim from Matches’ cult-favorite in-house line, Raey. I even found some sleek white <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g30295852/best-strappy-sandals-heels/><u>strappy sandals</u></a> on sale in there, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever has made Matches a shopping destination for you, there’s a high chance it’s included in the sale. There are, of course, a few pieces that touch on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/spring-2024-trends/><u>spring’s biggest trends</u></a> and others that are perfectly classic, like a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-designer-handbags/><u>designer bag</u></a> from Jil Sander that you can snag for a whopping 70 percent off.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep scrolling to shop all of our picks and to read a little more about why we adore them so much. Some are tried-and-true favorites and others are items that have lived rent-free in our shopping-minded brains for weeks now. Either way, this may be your last time to find them before Matches closes for good.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-shop-the-matches-sale><span>Shop The Matches' Sale</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Toteme The City Leather Sandals (Were $500)" data-url="https://www.matchesfashion.com/us/products/Toteme-The-City-leather-sandals-1532376#ref=womens%7Csale" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tcFg8ReN3TzYVWSheHF4cF-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Toteme The City Leather Sandals (Were $500)</p><p>"I have the soul of a Toteme girl, but not necessarily the budget of one.
